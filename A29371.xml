            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words, ye have an Exhortation to a great Duty, <hi>Viz.</hi> Attention, or taking heed to the Word of God, in dark, and dangerous Times, and Places. The Duty is commanded, and commended; <hi>Ye do well that ye take heed,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ye do well, or beautifully; this is your Chriſtian Beauty, and Comlineſs in the Eyes of God. Now this Duty is urged, and amplified; urged by divers Arguments; ſome taken from the excellency of the Word it ſelf. Firſt, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Word of Propheſie, or a Prophetical Word, written by Divine Inſpiration; the ſame that is ſpoken of in verſe 20. called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102264:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Scripture.</hi> Secondly, It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a more ſure Word: Some think the Comparative, is put for the Superlative; as <hi>Acts,</hi> 25.10. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as thou very wel (or beſt) knoweſt; But I take it rather to be meant Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; for the Word of God written, is ſurer than that Voyce which they heard in the Mount (whereof he ſpake in the former Verſe) More ſure is the Word written, than that Voyce of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; not <hi>ratione veritatis,</hi> not in regard of the Truth utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for that Voyce was as true as any word in the Scripture; but more ſure, <hi>ratione manifeſtationis,</hi> more certain, ſetled, and eſtabliſhed. Secondly: Some Arguments are taken from the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Word to us; for it is as a light ſhining in a dark place; and therefore it is good for us to take heed thereunto: But how long muſt we take heed to it? even as long as we live, and whilſt we are in the dark eſpecially, even <hi>till the day dawn, and the Sun ſhine</hi> in his ful ſtrength and brightneſs <hi>in your hearts;</hi> which is the Second thing, whereby this Duty is amplified.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Some think that is to be underſtood of a Supernatural Revelation, and Light, which God doth ſet up in the Soul; which when a man hath obtained, then he is to take heed to the written Word no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: But that cannot be: 1. Becauſe the Apoſtle doth here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the written Word before a Revelation from Heaven: Now if he do prefer it before a Divine Revelation, then it is not to give place to the dawning of ſome ſpecial Light, and Revelation in the Heart; for then he ſhould deſtroy in the latter part of the Verſe, what he had affirmed, and built up in the former part. 2. One Scripture is to be explained by another; but <hi>Eſai.</hi> 3.20. the Lord ſaith, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they speak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in them.</hi> If therefore, any man do pretend Light, or the ſhining of the morning Star in his Soul, ſo as to lay by the Word written, that Light is no true Light; and ſo this Interpretation can be no true Interpretation of theſe words. 3. This Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſuppoſe, that this morning Star did not ſhine in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Time, and that then the Apoſtles, with the Saints of thoſe Times, had not this Light within them; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have a more ſure Word, and ye do well that ye take heed thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</hi> Al the Saints, and People of God then, did walk by, and take heed unto the written Word; yet they had Light within them. This Interpretation therefore, is contrary to the ſence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he Apoſtle here.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others think that theſe Words are ſpoken to the beleeving Jews, in reference to the Prophets of the Old Teſtament: as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay; The glorious Light of the Goſpel hath not yet fully conquered your hearts; and therefore til your Goſpel-Light
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102264:12"/> be more cleer, you ſhal do wel to take heed to the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, who do al teſtifie with us of Chriſt. But this wil ſeem to argue, That when Goſpel-Light, doth more fully riſe upon us, then we may lay by the Prophets of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Others think that this day dawning, and the Day-ſtar ariſing, doth note that ful and cleer Viſion of God and Chriſt, which is yet to come. Now, becauſe the whol Earth ſhal be filled with the knowledg of the Lord in the latter daies (in reſpect to which Time, it's promiſed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.28. <hi>I will give him the morning-ſtar:</hi> and in Chap. 22.16. Chriſt doth appear to the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Title, ſaying, I <hi>am the bright morning-ſtar.</hi>)</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Therefore it is conceived by ſome, That the Apoſtle here doth relate to that time, and ſo the ſence of the words ſhould be this: Though now ye be in the dark, yet ye have the Light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to walk by; whereto ye ſhal do wel that ye take heed, til ye be brought to, and under a more glorious, and cleer Diſpenſation. But the word uſed for the morning-Star, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.22. is not the ſame that is here uſed, and tranſlated the Day-Star.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Scripture ſhal not be out of date in the daies of thoſe glorious Times; for the Wals of that City, the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſhal come down from Heaven, hath twelve Foundations, and in them, the names of the twelve Apoſtles of the Lamb, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.14.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This Interpretation doth ſuppoſe that the morning Star, or the Sun (for ſo the word may be rendred,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Suid.</note> as <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaith) doth not ſhine in our hearts now, and that it hath not ſhined already, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. concerning Chriſts firſt coming, verſe 78. <hi>Whereby the Day-spring from on high, hath viſited us to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; the day is far ſpent, and ye are the Children of Light, and of the day. Surely therefore, the day had then dawned in thoſe Times; and therefore theſe words cannot only relate to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Times that are yet to come.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Others ſay theſe words do relate unto Heavenly Glory, and ſo the meaning of the words ſhould be, That we are to take heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the written Word, until we come into Heaven; which thing is true: But where do we find in Scripture, that the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is ſaid thus to dawn, or ſhine in our hearts? Or that Chriſt is ſaid thus to ſhine in our hearts, in regard of Heavenly Glory?</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Therefore I think the word <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil,</hi> is not to be taken excluſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but as in other Scriptures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine Enemies thy foot-ſtool.</hi> Shal Chriſt ſit on Gods right hand no longer? Shal he not ſit there for ever? Yea, he ſhal ſit there for ever, after al Enemies are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued: But the words ſhew what Chriſt ſhal enjoy, and do, whilſt

As with a man in travel; When he comes upon ſuch, or ſuch an Hill, or Mountain, he ſees the Steeples, and Pinacles of the Town, which he is going to; then he comes into a Valley, and he loſeth the ſight of them again; then he comes again to another Hill, and then he ſees them again. So in our Journey, or travel to Heaven; we ſee ſuch and ſuch Truths to day, then we come into a Valley, and we loſe the ſight of them; then God raiſes our hearts again, and we ſee them again.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And though a good man may be in the dark, yet God doth not leave him ſo: as it is in the darkneſs of Fears, ſo in al other dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. ye read that when Chriſt roſe from the dead, the ſtone was rowled away from the Sepulchre, and they that were about it, were in great fear: There were keepers of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, whom the Jews had ſet to watch the ſame; and there were the Godly women, waiting for the Reſurrection: both were in fear, and in great fear: But the Angel appears to <hi>Mary,</hi> and the good women, ſaying, <hi>Fear not ye;</hi> ye ſeek Jeſus, he is riſen, he is not here, fear not ye: he did not ſay ſo to the wicked Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that kept, and watched the Sepulchre; they feared, and he left them in their fears, and in their dark Condition: but the good women feared, and were in a dark Condition; but the Lord did not leave them in it, but gave them Scripture-Light to comfort them; he is riſen, <hi>as he ſaid.</hi> So that a good man may be in the dark, yet God will not leave him in his Darkneſs; but even then he hath a Light, and a ſure Light to walk by. And that's the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly: This Scripture-Light, is the moſt excellent, ſafe, and ſure Light: It is the Light of Lights; the moſt excellent Light of al, under God in Chriſt. For,</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is a true Light. There are many falſe Lights in the World; but Scripture Light is the true Light. The proper work of Light, is to make manifeſt; <hi>They will not come to the Light</hi> (ſaith our Savior) <hi>leſt their deeds be made manifeſt.</hi> Now the Light of the Scripture, doth manifeſt things unto us; it is (by <hi>James</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Looking-glaſs. When ye look upon a Looking-glaſs, ye ſee three things; the Glaſs, your ſelf, and al the other things, Perſons, Stools, or Pictures, that are in the Room. So in looking in the Scripture, this great Looking-glaſs, ye ſee the Truths that are therein contained, concerning God, and Chriſt; there is God
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102264:16"/> ſeen eſpecially, and Chriſt ſeen; there alſo you ſee your ſelf, and your own dirty face; there alſo you ſee the Creatures that are in the room with you, and their emptineſs, the emptineſs of men, and of al comforts, and Relations. This is that manifeſting Light under Chriſt, that is true Light indeed.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As it is a true Light, ſo it is an admirable, and wonderful Light; for there are the wonderful things of Gods Law: whereupon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> prayed, <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I may ſee the wonderful things of thy Law:</hi> There is the Light of Chriſt, who is called a marvelous Light; and the more ye look into the Scripture, and know, the more ye wil admire: In other Knowledges, the more ye know, the leſs ye admire; <hi>Amor noti, admiratio ignoti:</hi> but in Scripture Knowledg, the more Light ye have, and the more ye know, the more you wil lift up your hands, and admire at your own Ignorance, and at Gods Grace. It is a moſt admirable Light.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As it is an admirable Light, ſo it is a ſafe, and a ſure Light. Other falſe Lights, do lead men into Fens, and Bogs; but we have a more ſure, and ſafe Light; and the more of it fals upon your Eye, the more is your Eye preſerved: 'Tis not ſo with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Lights; <hi>Vehemens ſenſiblle deſtruit ſenſorium:</hi> Your Eye is able to bear a moderate Light; but if the Light be vehement, your ſence is not able to bear it, but is deſtroyed by it: not ſo with this Scripture-Light, the ſtronger, and more vehement it is, the more it doth perfect the Eye of your Soul; it's not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, but it's perfective Light. Upon which account, <hi>Auſtin</hi> prayed to God, <hi>Sint ſacrae Scripturae tuae deliciae meae in quibus nec fallere poſſum nec fulli;</hi> O Lord (ſaid he) let thy Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be my delights, by which, I can neither deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As it is a ſafe, and ſure Light; ſo it is a pleaſant, and ſatisfying Light. Light is pleaſant to the Eye, and the Eye ordinarily is not ſatisfied with ſeeing; but this is that light which doth bring men to reſt: for when a man knows what ſhal be his Portion for ever, then his heart is at reſt, and not before. Now it is only the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Light thereof, which under Chriſt, doth diſcover, and manifeſt that unto men; <hi>Stand in the old, and good way</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>and ye ſhall find reſt.</hi> That way, is this Scripture way: if a man once depart from the Scripture, he runs from one Error to another, and he reſts not; but here is reſt to be found. This is that ſatisfying Light, which doth bring unto reſt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> As it is a pleaſant, ſatisfying Light; ſo it is a ful, and ſufficient Light, able to make the man of God perfect unto Salvation: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19. and it makes perfect, elſe it were no Rule of Life: for as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, the <hi>Regula</hi> muſt

Yea, 3. If a man do once come to attend, and take heed unto Viſions, and Revelations, how eaſily may he ſlide, and depart into Atheiſm? for what difference is there between an Atheiſt, or a Pagan Infidel, and a Chriſtian, but only this, That the Chriſtian is for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and doth adhere to that, the other not? Take away the Scripture from me, and there wil be little difference between me, and an Infidel. But now the more a man doth attend unto Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the more his heart and hands wil be looſed from the Scripture Surely therefore, there is a danger in this; but Scripture-Light, is a ſure, and a ſafe Light.</p>

                     </note> It's an hard thing to know whether the Dream be Natural, or Supernatural. In caſe it be Supernatural: Supernatural Dreams, are either Diabolical, from the Devil: or Divine, from God: and it's an hard thing to know whether it be of God, or from Satan. Some think, that if Dreams do greatly afflict and trouble the mind with ſome ſharp impreſſion, then they are of God, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaies <hi>Pilates</hi> Wife) <hi>I have ſuffered many things this night in a Dream:</hi> and this Dream of hers (ſay they) was of God. But others think rather, that it was from Satan, who would have hundred the death of Chriſt, and ſo the great Work of Mans Redemption. But if ye look into <hi>Job,</hi> 7. ye ſhal find that he ſaith to God, <hi>Thou skareſt me with Dreams;</hi> yet it was Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that did it: for as before, when Satan by his Inſtruments, took all from <hi>Job,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath taken away;</hi> ſo here, when Satan vexed and skared him with Dreams, he ſaith to God (acknowledging his Providence) Thou skareſt me with Dreams; and yet I ſay it was Satan: for he was put into Satans hand, and whatever affliction he met with, it was from Satan, and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So that the trouble, and ſuffering of the Dream, doth not argue that it is from God. It is a very hard thing to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of God, or from Satan: And in caſe that the Dream be of God, yet it is an hard thing to know the meaning, and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it: for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a Dream; but al his Magitians could not interpret it; that was a work for <hi>Joſeph:</hi> And ſo though <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had a Dream, and that might be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A wicked man may have a Dream from God; but it requires the Spirit of no leſs than a Prophet, to give the Interpretation thereof. But now, Are we at ſuch Uncertainties in reading the Word? Can none but a Prophet underſtand the Scripture? The Prieſts and Levites gave the Sence of the Word to the People ordinarily; yet they were no Prophets. The Word of the Lord, is a Light, and Lanthorn unto al our feet, plain and eaſie to be underſtood, in al thoſe things that are abſolutely neceſſary unto our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>And if God ſhould ſpeak to me by a Dream, yet if I make that a ſign of mine own Godlineſs, or of Gods Love to me, then am I under a deluſion; for even wicked men have had their D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Do I therefore dream a ſtrange Dream, and conclude that therefore I am in Gods Love, becauſe he thus ſpeaks to me? then am I deceived, What wiſe man is there in the World, that wil, or dare lay, and venture his Soul, and Salvation upon a Dream, or the Interpretation of it? But you may, and muſt ſay, and venture your Souls and Salvation upon the Scripture. Surely therfore the light of Dreams is not to be compared therewith.</p>

Now if the Providence of God, do thus extend to our very Sins, then we cannot make up our Judgment, our Rule from a bare Providence: but you may make up your Judgment and Rule from the Scripture, and the Word of God written.</p>

                     </note> Diſpoſition, or Opinion. It's a good ſpeech of <hi>Hilary;</hi> He is the beſt Interpreter of Scripture, that doth rather bring
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102264:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> his Senſe from the Scripture, than carry his Senſe to the Scripture. We are very apt to interpret Scripture according to our own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſpoſition. Interpretation ordinarily follows diſpoſition, or opinion: As when there was a great Controverſie in the Popiſh Church, betwixt the two Liturgies of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Gregory;</hi> by common conſent of both Parties, it was agreed, that both the Maſs Books ſhould be laid on the Altar, expecting the deciſion of the matter by Revelation: and the doors being opened the next morning, <hi>Gregories</hi> Maſs-Book was rent and torn in many pieces, and ſcattered abroad in the place; but <hi>Ambroſes</hi> lay whol, and open upon the Altar, which ſome thought ſignified thus much; That <hi>Gregories</hi> Maſs-Book ſhould be cancelled; others, as the Pope himſelf ſaid, nay, but this renting and ſcattering of the Leaves, ſignified the diſperſing of it over al the Chriſtian World. Thus men interpret things, according to their own Diſpoſitions and Opinions, even when they come to Scripture alſo. Would you therefore ſee cleerly into the mind of God in the Scripture? then, as when you come to Chriſt for Righteouſneſs, ye come with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſhoulders; ſo when you come to the Truth of Chriſt, take heed of your own Diſpoſition, and Opinion: you muſt come to Chriſt as a Prophet, as wel as to Chriſt as a Prieſt, with naked ſhoulders.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly: If you do deſire ſo to underſtand the Scripture, as it may be a Light to al your paths; then be ſure that you put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in Commiſſion with it for your Rule. 'Tis with the Scripture in this reſpect, as with God, Chriſt, and the Spirit; If you come to God for help, yet if you joyn another God in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion with him, he wil not give down his help: ſo if you joyn any thing with Chriſt in the matter of Mediation, though you come to him, he wil not give in the comfort of his Mediation to you: ſo for the Spirit, though you come unto him for comfort, being the Comforter; yet if you joyn any thing elſe in Commiſſion with the Spirit, it wil not give down his Comfort. And ſo here; though you come, and tend, and wait upon God in the Scripture; yet if there be any thing elſe which you do make your Joynt-Rule with the Scripture, any Light within you, or Precept of Man without you, it wil not give down its Light to you, but you wil be left in the dark. Do you deſire therefore, to underſtand and know the true ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture? then take heed that you joyn no other thing in Commiſſion with it, as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your Rule. And thus I have done with the firſt thing that we muſt do in taking heed to the Scripture; we muſt take heed to know, and underſtand the ſame.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If you would ſo take heed unto the Scripture, as it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Light unto you in a dark place, then you muſt keep it;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102264:43"/> for though the Meat be never ſo good, yet if the Stomach throw it up preſently, and do not keep it, it doth the man no good. So in regard of the Scripture: therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We ought to take the more earneſt heed unto the things that we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip,</hi> or <hi>run out:</hi> We muſt keep what we have, we muſt keep what we know, elſe we do not take heed to the Word.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may keep, and not forſake the Word,</p>

So, though I ſay, God forbid that ever I ſhould deny the Scripture, yet if I lie playing upon the confines of this ſin, I ſhal certainly fal into it. 'Tis an excellent Speech that <hi>Luther</hi> hath, Wil any man play? let him play with his Wife, play with his Children, play with his Money; but let him take heed how he plaies with the Scripture, by turning al into Myſticalneſs; for who is it that dares play with the Thunder? Why? (ſaies he) for it is the Voyce of God: So is the Scripture, it is the Voyce of God. Would ye therefore, ſo take heed unto it, as to keep it, and not deny the ſame? Then take heed of that corruption of Nature which doth boyl up to malice; take heed of evil Principles about the Rule of your life; and take heed of playing with the Scripture, and of living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the confines of that great ſin of denying it, leſt God in juſt Judgment, give you up at laſt to the groſs evil of it.</p>

And if it be, then think with your ſelf, how hard a thing it wil be for you to be ſaved, denying that Doctrine which al the Saints generally have maintained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the World; but above al, take heed of an itching Ear. The Apoſtle tels <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 4.3. That the times ſhould

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly: Yet one thing more. If you would take heed to the Scripture, you muſt ſo heed the ſame, as you may walk thereby.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Therefore prize it much: Who takes heed to that which he don't prize? The Martyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies, prized the written Word of God much: one gave a Cart-load of Hay for one Leaf of the Bible in Engliſh: another being at Sea, and ſwimming for his life on a Maſt, and having al his Eſtate (which was five pound) in one hand, and the Bible in the other, and being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to part with one, choſe rather for to keep the Bible, and throw away his five pound, al that he had. Theſe then did prize the written Word of God, and they did walk thereby.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Therefore alſo, get your heart affected with Love to every Truth which you know; for becauſe men receive not the Truth in the Love thereof, therefore God doth give them up to ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions: men take heed unto what they love.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And therefore that you may heed it ſo as to walk thereby, let it be your continual Companion, going where you go; if you go into the Fields, O! let the Word go with you; if into your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, O! let the Scripture, and the written Word of God be with you: Thus ſhal you take heed unto it, as to a Light ſhining in a dark place. And I pray tel me, are not theſe times, dark times? The conjunction of Clouds, and Miſeries, make dark times. Now the World is ful of Wars, and Rumors of Wars: now men ſay, lo, here is Chriſt, and lo, there is Chriſt; inſomuch as (if poſſible) the Elect would be deceived. Now ſpiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and outward Miſeries, are in Conjunction; a Cloud and a Cloud, a Conjunction of Clouds: ſurely therefore, theſe times muſt be dark times. The Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, and the falling of the Stars from Heaven, make dark times: And when were there more Eclipſes, and falling of the Stars, and of great Lights from Heaven, than in theſe daies of ours? Falſe Lights alſo make dark times; for the more Falſe Lights are ſet up, the more men are drawn from the true Light, and ſo the more they are in darkneſs: And when ever were there ſo many falſe Lights hung
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102264:44"/> forth, as in theſe daies of ours? Surely therefore, theſe are dark times; and if ſo, what cauſe have we al, to take heed unto the Word, which is as a Light ſhining in a dark place. What I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay to one, I ſay to you al, and to my own Soul; O! let us al take heed thereunto. And if any think, that he is not at al in the dark, he is therefore in the dark, becauſe he thinks he is not in the dark: If any think theſe things concern not him, they do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more concern him than others, becauſe he thinks they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him not. Think therefore on al theſe things, and the Lord give you a cleer underſtanding in al things.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> And upon this account, al poor ſinners may be encouraged to come to Chriſt; for if Chriſt did come down from Heaven for you, wil he refuſe you when you come to him? If he have ſuffered ſuch hard and bitter things for ſinners, do ye think he wil caſt them away that do come to him? ſurely he wil not. O! what great encouragement doth this Doctrine proclaim unto al poor, and great ſinners, for to come to Chriſt.</p>

No, Why? but becauſe ſhe hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled for it? But behold, here is a Travel beyond al Travels; Chriſt travelling in the greatneſs of his Love for poor ſinners, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling under the Wrath of God, his Father, and wil he forget you that are his Seed? <hi>Though a Woman forget her Child, yet will not I ſaith the Lord.</hi> O! what Comfort is this for all the Seed of Chriſt; Chriſt hath had a ſore travel for you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſure your ſelves, he wil never forget you.

But this cannot be the next, and immediate effect of the Death of Chriſt; for God was reconcilable before Chriſt died, and had not only a velleity, but a ful wil to ſhew mercy to us; for <hi>John,</hi> 3. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he ſent his only begotten Son:</hi> Now if the Love of God to Man-kind were the cauſe of Chriſts coming into the World, then he was reconcilable before the Death of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>But this cannot be, for then Chriſt died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the Power of God, out of the hand of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for that which is delivered by the Death of

This doth ſuppoſe that God was willing to ſhew mercy to man, and to do that for man which he could not do; but that cannot be with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man may be willing to do that, which in Juſtice he cannot do, becauſe his wil may be unjuſt, but Gods wil cannot be unjuſt; and therefore he cannot wil that which he cannot do in Juſtice. 3.

What ſtate ſhal redeemed man be in preſently upon this account, not under the Goſpel, for God is left free by the Death of Chriſt, they ſay, to appoint what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he pleaſes, and not under the Law; for he was by Chriſt redeemed from the Law. 7. If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the New Covenant, were the next Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts death (as appears by <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15.) then Chriſt did not die to procure ſuch a power, and liberty to God, that he might appoint what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he pleaſed.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly: Some think that Chriſt by his Death, hath obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſufficiency of Grace for al men; ſo that al men may, or may not beleeve, if they wil: and this obtainment of this ſufficiency of Grace for al, they think is the great, and next Effect of the Death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But this cannot be: for the thing is not true, <hi>viz.</hi> That al men have a ſufficiency of Grace by Chriſt, to beleeve on him: for if al the men of the World have ſuch a Power from Chriſt to beleeve on him, then, 1. The Jews had a Power to abſtain from their Unbelief, in putting Chriſt to death, and yet they had this Power from the Death of Chriſt; and if ſo, then it was poſſible that Chriſt ſhould not have died by the hand of their Unbelief, and yet poſſible by vertue of Chriſts Death, for them to abſtain from the putting him to death, which is a Contradiction: Neither can it be ſaid, that they had this Power given them upon the fore-ſight of Chriſts Death; for the ſame fore-ſight, did fore-ſee that Chriſt ſhould be put to death by the hand of their Unbelief. 2. If al men have ſuch a Power to beleeve in Chriſt, then either they muſt have an inward Principle of Grace and Faith; or they can act without an inward Principle: but they have no inward Principle of Faith and Grace, for then they ſhould be Beleevers; for it is the inward ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and principle, which denominates the man, and not this, or that act, for a man is a Beleever, though he be aſleep: Nor can any Creature put forth an act without an inward Principle ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Act; the Eye cannot act in ſeeing, without an inward Principle of ſight; nor the Ear hear, without an inward principle of hearing: the Herb cannot grow, without an inward principle of growth; nor the Beaſt move, without an inward principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor any Creature act, without a precedent inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But al the men of the World, have not an inward principle
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102264:59"/> of Faith and Grace; and therefore al the men of the World have not a power to beleeve. 3. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> tels us plainly, that a <hi>Natural man receiveth not the things of God, neither can he,</hi> 1. Cor. 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. but if he have a power to beleeve, then he can receive them; for receiving is our beleeving, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 12. Neither can it be ſaid, that by the <hi>Natural man,</hi> we are to underſtand the weak Chriſtian; for if the weak Chriſtian cannot receive the things of God, much leſs the wicked, and the pure Natural man: nor doth the Apoſtle ſpeak of a Natural Man, as he is meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the ſtate of Nature, abſtracted from al Goſpel Grace, and the means of Grace; for then he ſhould ſpeak to no particular caſe in the World, for (according to our Adverſaries) there is no man in the World, but hath ſome Goſpel Grace, or means of Grace. 4. Our Savior Chriſt tels the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 10.26. <hi>Ye beleeve not, becauſe ye are not of my Sheep;</hi> it ſeems then, that al the world are not the Sheep of Chriſt; for ſaith he, ye are not of my Sheep; and the reaſon why ſome do beleeve, is becauſe they are of Chriſts Sheep; and why others beleeve not, is becauſe they are not of his Sheep: Now if the reaſon why ſome beleeve, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not, is becauſe ſome are of his Sheep, and others not; then al the world have not a power to beleeve: for if al the world have a power to beleeve, then thoſe that are not of the Sheep may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; and if thoſe that are not of the Sheep, can beleeve, why doth our Savior give this as a Reaſon why they did not beleeve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not of his Sheep? 5. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhal they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? and how ſhal they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent:</hi> But now al the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men in the world, have not heard of a crucified Chriſt, by the preaching of the Goſpel. And if it be ſaid, Yes, but the Sun, Moon, and Stars, do preach Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Their ſound, and words, is gone forth into all the Earth.</hi> I anſwer, It's true indeed, that the Apoſtle doth here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to that 19. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it's ſaid, that the Voyce of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, is gone forth unto al the Earth; but the Apoſtle doth not contradict himſelf; for he ſaith, <hi>How can they beleeve in him, of whom they have not heard? and how can they hear without a Preacher, and a Preacher ſent?</hi> If men can hear of Chriſt, by the Preaching of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, then they can hear of Chriſt, without the preaching of one ſent, which he denies, ver. 14, 15. And if the Sun, Moon, and Stars, do preach Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, then is the Matter of the Goſpel no Divine Revelation: And then why might not <hi>Adam</hi> beleeve in Chriſt in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency? the Sun, Moon, and Stars, preach the ſame Doctrine now, that they preached then; and then, the ſame that they preach

It ſeems by this Speech, that none can die for us in that ſenſe that Chriſt died for us, but ſuch as whoſe Names we may be baptized into; but one man may die for anothers profit and benefit (as the Martyrs have done) and yet the other may not be baptized into his Name: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>Chriſt died for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> verſe 6. <hi>ſcarcely for a righteous man wil one die; yet peradventure for a good man, ſome wil even dare to die,</hi> verſe 7.

                     </note> But the Scope of the Apoſtle in Chap. 9. of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is to ſhew that the Blood of Chriſt, is more efficacious in it ſelf, than the blood of al the Buls and Goats; and therfore it was not ſatisfying in a way of Divine Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, but in a way of intrinſecal worth and merit. Now, if the price that Chriſt laid down for us, was in it ſelf ſufficient to ſatisfie, and this was not wreſted from him, but he did freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up unto God for us, and he did pay, and ſuffer al this in our room and ſtead, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to us, and inflicted on him by the hand of the Father, then God the Father muſt needs be ſatisfied with this great payment; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was, as appears by that entertainment which he gave unto Chriſt, when Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, ſaying, <hi>Sit thou on my right hand:</hi> Surely therefore, the Satisfaction of Divine Wrath, and Juſtice, was an immediate effect of the Death of Chriſt, which he ſaw preſently.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: As he did ſatisfie the Law, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, for al his Seed; ſo he did by his Death, ſanctifie, and ſet them apart for God, conſecrating them, even al thoſe that he travelled with, to the uſe and Service of the Lord: for as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did prophane, debauch, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file al his Seed, by his Diſobedience; ſo the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> did by his Obedience, conſecrate, ſanctifie, and ſet apart his Seed for God; for ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will, we are ſanctified through the offering of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt:</hi> and again, verſe 14. <hi>For by one Offering, he hath perfected</hi> (that is, conſecrated, ſaith <hi>Calvin) for ever, them that are ſanctified.</hi> And ſaith our Savior,<note place="margin">Omnes prorſus authores quos ego legerim interpretantur pro iis ego me in ſacrificium offero, et cum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, ut ſint ipſi ſanctificati in verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, ſignificat initiari conſecrarique ſacrificio.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102264:62"/> offered unto God, as our firſt Fruits; then al the crop, and lump, muſt be ſanctified thereby; but when he died, he was offered up unto God, as our firſt Fruits; and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are of one,</hi> as the firſt Fruits, and the Crop, or Lump were of one; plainly therefore, when Chriſt died for us, he did then ſanctifie, and ſet apart al thoſe whom he died for: and ſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, and ſanctification of his Seed, is another Fruit, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Effect of his Death.</p>

                     </note> Only the Queſtion is, How this Covenant was confirmed by the death of Chriſt? The Socinians ſay, That Chriſts death did confirm the Covenant by way of Teſtimony, or Declaration of the Truth of the Goſpel; the Lord ſay they hath promiſed in the Goſpel, that al thoſe who repent and beleeve, ſhal be juſtified and ſaved. Now Chriſt preaching this Truth, and dying in it, hath confirmed this Truth, and the Goſpel; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, Chriſt is called the true, and the faithful Witneſs. 1. But though Chriſt by his death, did bear his Teſtimony to the Truth of the Goſpel, yet where do we find in Scripture, that his death did confirm the Covenant by way of Teſtimony? 2. Where doth it appear that the Covenant which he confirmed by his death, was this, If you repent, and beleeve, you ſhal be ſaved, and juſtified? The thing is true, and a Goſpel Truth, but the Covenant which Chriſt confirmed, ye read of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. where the Lord doth promiſe both Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance alſo. 3. If the death of Chriſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Covenant by way of Teſtimony, teſtifying the Truth of the Goſpel; then the death of the Martyrs ſhould confirm the Covenant, more than the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102264:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> death of Chriſt: for the Socinians deny the Deity of Chriſt; and if Chriſt were only Man, then the death of thouſands (ſome dying more painful deaths than Chriſt did) ſhould give a greater Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the Truth of the Goſpel, and ſo confirm the Covenant more than the death of Chriſt: but where do we find in al the Scripture, that the death of the Martyrs is ſaid to confirm the New Covenant?<note place="margin">

If the Death of Chriſt, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Covenant by way of Teſtimony, then the blood of Buls and Goats, might have confirmed the Covenant; for when God teſtified the Truth of his Promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 15. <hi>He ſaid to him, Take thee an Heifer of three years old, and a ſhee Goat of three yeers old, and a Turtle Dove, and a yong Pidgeon; and he took them, and divided them in the mid'ſt,</hi> ver. 9, 10. But the Apoſtle tels us plainly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. That the blood of Buls and Goats could not confirm the Covenant. 6. The Ordinance of the Lords Supper, doth teſtifie Gods willingneſs to forgive ſinners; <hi>That Cup is the New Teſtament in Chriſts blood, ſhed for many for the remiſſion of ſins:</hi> But though the Lords Supper be a Seal of the Covenant, ſealing to us, evidencing, teſtifying, and aſſuring us of Gods Love b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eal to us, but was a Seal of the Covenant it ſelf, as it lay between God the Father, and him. But if Chriſts death, did only confirm the Covenant by way of Teſtimony, then the Lords Supper might as wel be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Covenant, which is no where affirmed in the Scripture. But 7. Look how the Obedience of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhould have confirmed the Covenant, in caſe he had ſtood; and look how he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102264:65"/> broke that Covenant by his Diſobedience; ſo did the Death, and Obedience of Chriſt, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> confirm the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Now if the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and confirmed that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he had confirmed it by performing the Condition of it; and he brake it by not obſerving, and not doing the Condition of it: ſo the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt, did confirm the new Covenant by his Death, and in that, by his Obedience, he did perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New Covenant for his Seed: Thus I ſay, he confirmed the Covenant of Grace, even by performing the Condition of it; and this confirmation of the Covenant, was the next, and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Fruit, and Effect of his Death. And thus you have ſeen both Negatively, and Affirmatively, what are not, and what are, the next, and immediate Effects of the Death of Chriſt.</p>

If Chriſts Merits were thus conditional; then the <hi>Will</hi> of God the Father muſt be alſo conditional, for there is a correſpondency between the Merits of Chriſt, and the Wil of the Father; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wils that to us, which the Son hath merited for us; and as the Son merited, ſo doth the Father wil the beſtowing of the bleſſing: but the Father doth not wil our Grace, Holineſs, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication upon condition; for the Maintainers of that Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption, ſay, That Gods ſecret Wil, and his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wil, are one and the ſame, nothing different; if therefore, God doth wil our Sanctification, and Holineſs, upon Condition, then, when he commands us to beleeve, repent, and obey, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102264:75"/> muſt be Conditional: and when he commands us to forſake our ſins, his Command (for that is Gods Wil) muſt be Conditional; and if thoſe Commandements be conditional, then they cannot be reſiſted, nor his Wil reſiſted, yea, then it wil be no ſin not to keep Gods Commandement; for if his Commandement be to be obſerved upon Condition, then if I do not perform that Condition, I do not tranſgreſs his Commandement; as if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand your Servant to do a thing <hi>if he will;</hi> if he wil not, he doth not tranſgreſs your Commandement: Surely therefore, the Wil of God, and his Commandements are abſolute; ſuch therefore is the Merit of Chriſt.</p>

I grant that one benefit of the Death of Chriſt, doth follow another, and one may be the cauſe of the other: but our Lord and Savior Chriſt, did not die conditionally, nor merit any thing for us conditionally; thoſe that he died for, he merited Grace and Holineſs for, to be given out to them without al conditions; and therefore if he died for al men, he muſt needs loſe his Purchaſe, a thing moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying to the heart of Chriſt: yet this is the firſt-born of that Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption.

                     <p>Secondly: If Chriſt wil certainly ſee the Travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied, then here you may ſee the reaſon why we cannot be ſatisfied with that Opinion of the Saints Apoſtacy: this alſo is unſatisfying to the heart of Chriſt: Can a man be ſatisfied in ſeeing, and feeling one of his own Members torn from his Body? Can a man delight in ſeeing that Leg or Arm, which was once
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102264:78"/> the Member of his Body, burning in the fire? Surely Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; Chriſts Love is not like to ours; <hi>Non amat tanquam oſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus: Thoſe whom he loves once, he doth love to the end;</hi> once in Chriſt, and for ever in Chriſt; once loved by Chriſt, and for ever loved by him: <hi>Whom God hath called, them he hath alſo juſtified; and whom he hath juſtified, them he hath alſo glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>This is the Fathers Will</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John,</hi> 6.39.) <hi>that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe none;</hi> and verſe 37. he ſaith, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come unto me:</hi> It ſeems therefore, that there are ſome whom the Father hath given unto Chriſt, and that before they beleeve, their Faith being the Fruit and Conſequent of this Gift; therefore there is a particular Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome, and that Election is not upon a fore-fight of Faith, but a cauſe thereof. 2. Our Savior tels us here, <hi>That all thoſe that are given him, ſhall come to him;</hi> that is, they ſhal beleeve: therefore it is not in our power to reſiſt the Grace of God, with an over-coming reſiſtance: the converting Grace of God, is irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 3.

But al the men of the World do not come to him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not his Seed and Children, therefore he never travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with them, therefore he did not die for al particular men. 4. Our Savior tels us here plainly, that when men do come to him, he wil loſe none of them; but ſaith he, <hi>I wil raiſe them up at the laſt day,</hi> verſe 39. And leſt any ſhould doubt of this Truth, he ſpeaks yet more plainly; tels us that thoſe who do come, are ſuch as beleeve on him, and then for more aſſurance, repeats the Promiſe, verſe 40. ſaying, <hi>This is the Will of him which ſent me, That every one that ſeeth the Son, and I beleeveth on him, may have everlaſting Life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Surely therefore, that Doctrine of the Saints Apoſtacy, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound, yea, al the four Doctrines of the Arminians, are by this one Scripture, plainly refuted; but eſpecially that of the Saints Apoſtacy: It is a Doctrine not only uncomfortable to the Saints, but unſatisfying to the heart of Chriſt; <hi>For he ſhal ſee the Travel of his Soul, and be ſatisfied:</hi> Seeing therefore that he travelled for their Salvation, he ſhal ſee their perſeverance, and Salvation.</p>

                  <p>The latter of theſe being the main, is that indeed which I ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aim at: But becauſe the two former will give the better riſe unto this laſt, and they are alſo profitable for us to conſider, I ſhall take them in their order, and ſpeak only unto the firſt at this time; which is this:

                  <p>And indeed, how can it be otherwiſe? For the Saints and people of God, do walk with God, they converſe with God, they do acquaint themſelves with God. Now if ye look into <hi>Job,</hi> 22.21. ye ſhal find, that this acquaintance bringeth reſt &amp; peace. <hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at peace.</hi> The Saints and people of God, are (as I may ſo ſpeak) of Gods ſpecial acquaintance, and ſo they have peace, for they do walk with God, and have communion with him. They have communion with the Father; and he is the God of al conſolation; they have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102264:83"/> communion and fellowſhip with the Son; and he is the Prince of peace; they have communion and fellowſhip with the Spirit, and he is the Comforter: they have communion with the Father, and the Son, and the Spirit, in and by the Goſpel; and that is the word of peace, the Goſpel of peace. How can it therefore be, but that the Saints and people of God ordinarily ſhould have peace within?</p>
                  <p>But to make out this more fully unto you. Conſider I pray, How the Father, the Son, and the Holy-ghoſt (with whom the Saints and people of God have communion and fellowſhip) are engaged for their peace.</p>

Though the Garment that the Saints do ordinarily wear, be white, yet here and there ſome do go in black, and go ſo a great while. But that there may be no ſtumbling concerning this matter, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to conſider with me, ſome few Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt: Ye muſt know, That there is a Fundamental Peace, which the Saints and People of God have; and there is an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Peace. A Fundamental Peace, which does Naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and ſlow from their Juſtification: <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have Peace with God;</hi> Rom. 5. And then there is an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Peace, which ariſes from the ſence of their Juſtification. Poſſibly a Child of God may for a long time loſe the latter, but the former he ſhal never loſe. As a Woman that hath a great Joynture, goes abroad ſome Journey, and meets with Theeves, and they take away all the money that ſhe hath about her; but yet (ſaies ſhe) though they have taken away my ſpending Money, they cannot take away my Joynture, I have not loſt my Joynture. So now the Saints ſomtimes, may loſe their ſpending money, they may loſe the peace that ariſes from the ſence of their Juſtification; but as for the Peace that ariſeth and iſſues from their Juſtification
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102264:85"/> it ſelf, the firſt Peace, that they ſhall never loſe. Peace is the Churches Joynture, and that Peace they ſhal never loſe.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly: Ye muſt know, That there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Peace, Comfort, and Joy. A man may have Peace that hath no Comfort; a man may have Comfort that hath no Joy: one is beyond the other, one a degree above the other. As now, it may be day-light, and yet the Sun may not ſhine forth; the Sun may ſhine forth, and yet not noon-day. Poſſibly a man may have Peace, and yet not much Comfort, only ſtayed upon God; poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a man may have Comfort, and yet not much Joy. But now, many a poor ſoul thinks, becauſe he hath no Joy, therefore he hath no Comfort; and becauſe he hath not much Comfort, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Peace. Labor to know the difference between theſe.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly: Ye muſt know, That there is a Peace, which lies in oppoſition to what one hath been; and a Peace, that is in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what one would be. A godly man, a weak Chriſtian, when he conſiders what he would be, and what he would have, he hath no reſt nor quiet: But now, come unto the ſame man, and ſay thus, You remember what a wicked life once you led; ye were a Drunkard, or ye were a Wanton: What ſay ye? would you be in that condition again? Oh no, ſaith he then, I would not be in that condition for all the world. Here now the Soul hath Peace in oppoſition to what it hath been, though it hath not Peace and Quiet in oppoſition to what it would be.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: Ye muſt know, That there is a Secret, Dormant Peace; and there is a wakened and Apparent Peace: Peace in the Seed, and Peace in the Flower. As it is with many a wicked man, for the preſent he hath great Comfort; but when affliction comes, and the day of death comes, then he hath trouble; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in regard of ſin; Why? the ſin, and guilt was in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, only it lay ſleeping there, but now it is riſen. So with a Godly man in regard of his Peace: poſſibly for the preſent, he may be full of trouble; but when affliction comes, and the hour of death comes, then he hath Peace and Comfort; Why? it was there before, it was at the bottom, only he was not aware of it, he did not know of it. For now, ask ſuch a weak Chriſtian who is thus full of fear for the preſent (ye ſee there is a Drunkard, a Swearer, a Wanton) Would you be in his Condition? would you be contented to be in that mans condition? O no, ſaies he, I would not be in ſuch a condition for all the world. And why doth he ſay ſo, but becauſe there is a peace and quietude at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, although he be not aware of it? It is true, the Saints grieve, but then, <hi>dolent et de dolore gaudent;</hi> they rejoyce that they can grieve: they are troubled for ſin; and they have reſt and quiet in this, That they can be troubled for their ſin: they have no Peace
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102264:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> in their ſin; but they have peace in this, that they can have no peace in their ſin. For ſay now unto them, are ye troubled that ye are troubled; you are in ſome meaſure grieved for ſin; and are ye troubled that ye are grieved? No, wil they ſay, I am glad that I am grieved for ſin; and the Lord knows, it is my trouble that I can be grieved no more; I have quiet and peace in that I am troubled. Some have peace in the direct act, and ſome have peace in the Reflex act, Some have it more at the firſt hand, and ſome have it more at the ſecond hand. But conſider al theſe diſtinctions, and you wil find, that there is no godly man, but more or leſs in ſome of theſe reſpects, he may be ſaid to have peace within. But ſuppoſe it be ſo, What is the iſſue of this Doctrine? what doth it tend and lead unto?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Applic.</note>The iſſue is thus much. Then behold! what a bleſſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Saints and people of God are in? Is it not a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſed thing to have peace within; to have quiet, peace, and reſt within? If ye have peace within; though ye want peace without, you wil be able to hear al your burthens,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.14</note> 
                     <hi>The spirit of a man wil ſuſtain his infirmities.</hi> But a wounded ſpirit who can bear? Some bear Agues and Feavers; ſome bear Stones, and Collicks, Rackings and Tormentings; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? O but the ſpirit of a man wil ſuſtain his infirmities, if he have peace within; if he be Heart-whole, as they ſay, if he have peace within then wil he be able to bear al his burthens. Ye ſee into what times we are now fallen; we cannot promiſe our ſelves peace for a day together; ſuddenly a cloud may ariſe, in a night, and al our comforts laid in the dark; How good a thing is it then, to have peace within, to have reſt and quiet within! If I have peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, I can relieve my ſelf here againſt al calamity. What though I have trouble from my friends? yet I have peace within: what though I am thus reproached? yet I have peace within; I am wet indeed, my garment is wet; but I am not wet to the skin, I am dry within,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Math.</hi> 5.4.</note> I have peace within. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſaies our ſavior) <hi>are thoſe that mourn for they ſhal be comforted.</hi> Are thoſe bleſſed for the preſent that ſhal be comforted? how bleſſed are thoſe then that are comforted, and that have peace, and quiet already.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine lookes wiſhly, both upon the ungodly, and upon the Godly.

When God ſpeaks peace, he ſpeaks it with a ſtrong hand: giving ſuch peace, as no creature in the world is able to give. When God ſpeaks peace, it is a peace beyond al expreſſion; The peace of God that paſſeth al underſtanding, it cannot be uttered. Now though a wicked man have peace, and much peace and quiet within, yet God doth not ſpeak it; for it was not ſpoken to him in or after temptation, it was not ſpoken by a ſtrong and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable hand; it is ſuch a peace, as may be wrought by time,

But now as for you that are God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that make this Objection, and have this fear and ſcruple in your hearts; I wil here appeal unto your own ſouls; you know and remember your former trouble; now ye have peace, and ye have reſt within, I appeal to you (I ſay) whether yea or no, when ye were in that trouble, ſuppoſe I, or another Miniſter, or ten o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of your own chuſing, ſuppoſe a hundred ſhould have come to you with one promiſe after another; had we been able to have ſpoken comfort to you?

Wel, yet I appeal to you further; And do not you find that you have peace, even then when you do ſee your ſins? and the more you ſee your ſins upon the back of Chriſt, the more peace you have? yes; And do not you find this, that your peace came in, in a way of Beleeving? from the ſight of Chriſt? laying hold on the Promiſe? by the proſpect of free Grace? yes, I muſt needs ſay ſo, Had I not had a promiſe to ſtay my ſoul upon; had I not had a view of tree Grace; had I not ſeen the Lord Jeſus, I had never had any peace in my poor ſoul; but the Lord knows, that thus I attained my peace. Wel then, be of good comfort, Man or Woman, I tell thee from the Lord, thy peace and quiet is right.

As one drunkard doth make another, and one ſwearer doth beget another, and one oppoſer of Godlineſs doth draw on another, and one adulterer doth make another; So one doubting Chriſtian doth make another.

Do you therefore want Comfort, and peace?

                  <p>Ye know how it was with <hi>Nathaniel:</hi> When <hi>Nathaniel</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved upon what Chriſt had ſpoken, ſaies Chriſt unto him, <hi>Beleeveſt thou, becauſe I ſaid unto thee, I ſaw thee under the Fig-tree?

Look into <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. verſ. 18. and there you ſhal find the Lord ſpeaking thus, <hi>O that thou hadſt hearkened to my Commandements, then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteouſneſs as the waves of the Sea.</hi> When the Lord ſpeaks, and cals upon people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, if then they do hearken to him, then ſhal their peace be like a river. And when does the Lord cal in a ſpecial manner upon people to beleeve? When he gives out a word, and when he gives them a little peace, then he is calling upon them to beleeve, now return, and now beleeve, ſaies the Lord. Ye know how it was with <hi>Eliah;</hi> when they wanted rain, and had wanted rain for a long time, <hi>Eliah</hi> ſends his ſervant towards the Sea, to ſee if he could perceive any rain coming, and <hi>Eliah</hi> fals down upon his face in prayer, his ſervant goes, but no ſign of rain, he goes again, and no ſign of rain; and the ſeventh time <hi>Eliah's</hi> ſervant perceives a cloud, of the bigneſs of an hand, and he comes down unto his Maſter, and tells him, he had ſeen a cloud, the bigneſs of a mans hand: Whereupon <hi>Eliah</hi> concludes and ſaies, Come, let us up, <hi>I hear the noiſe of many waters.</hi> So ſay I, you have been upon your face, and have been much diſcouraged, yet if you have been at prayer, and a little refreſhment comes, though it be but the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an hand: yet conclude and ſay, ſurely, there is more rain a coming, Come, O my ſoul, Why art thou caſt down? and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope in God, and wait on him, I hear abundance of rain a coming. When our Savior Chriſt ſometimes ſpeaks peace, he doth at the firſt ſpeak by a ſmal word, and if that be improved, then he ſpeaks more.

                  <p>In General: It is for their good, for their good they have, and for their good they do want their Peace and Comfort: The Star which led the wiſe men to Chriſt, did not alwaies go before them, but ſomtimes it appeared, ſomtimes it was hidden from them; but both appearance and hiding was for their benefit: its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance invited them to Chriſt, and its withdrawance made them more diligent in ſeeking after him. So when Chriſt hid himſelf from his Mother <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe ſought him the more, and when ſhe found him, ſhe rejoyced the more: but both his abſence and his preſence, her fear and her comfort, was for her good; for his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did encreaſe and draw out her deſires, and his preſence did encreaſe and draw out her joyes. When God is abſent from us, then we have teſtimonies of our Love to God (by our deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him,) and when he is preſent, then we have teſtimonies of his Love to us, by the ſhines of his Countenance; ſo that whether God ſhines or not, whether we have comfort or not, both is for our good. Thus in the General, but yet more Particularly.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Ye know it is Gods way and manner to deal with the Children of men, according to their own diſpoſitions, to ſtoop and condeſcend unto their infirmities: Therefore ſaies the Prophet <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

                     <hi>He draws us with the Cords of a man.</hi> Now it is mans diſpoſition to come to God at the ſecond hand: So long as man can find a fulneſs in any Creature, he comes not to God; but firſt he ſees an emptineſs in the Creature, Duty, and Ordinance, and then he ſaies, O what a fulneſs is in God himſelf, in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Widdow that is deſolate, truſteth in God:</hi> though a Widdow, yet if not deſolate (ſomtimes) ſhe would not truſt; and therefore God ſuffers a deſolation to come upon her Widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. When <hi>Davids</hi> men took up ſtones to have ſtoned him, then (the Text ſaies) <hi>He encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6.</note> So long as man hath encouragement elſ-where, he doth not encourage himſelf in the Lord his God. This being mans Nature, and God having a deſign of Love upon his own Children, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a damp and diſcouragement to paſs upon all their Comforts; their Peace to be interrupted, their hearts diſquieted, and their ſouls diſcouraged, that ſo they may encourage themſelves in God alone.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly: This inward Peace and quietneſs of ſoul, is ſo great a Commodity, that God would have the price to be inhanced and raiſed. Common and ordinary bleſſings once loſt, and found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, are extraordinary: It is a common and ordinary mercy that a man ſits in his Shop, and walks up and down in his Trade; but if he be ſick a while, loſe his health, and not able for five or ſix weeks to look into his Shop; if then he can get down but one day, O ſaies
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102264:96"/> he, what an extraordinary mercy and bleſſing is it, that I ſhould go down again: Thus the interruption of an ordinary bleſſing, does raiſe it to an extraordinary. So long as a man hath his health and ſtrength, though he be able to travel forty, fifty, three-ſcore miles a day, he is not much affected therewith; but if he be ſick a little, and at deaths door, and then begins to recover, though he can but put forth his Hand, or ſtir his Leg, he bleſſes God, and ſaies, O Friends, I can ſtir my ſelf in my bed, I can move my Hand, or my Leg; what an extraordinary mercy and bleſſing is this! So in this caie, So long as a man hath inward Peace and quietneſs of ſoul, without interruption, he looks upon it as a common mercy and bleſſing; but if his Peace be a little interrupted, and his ſoul buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted by Satan, and then he recovers his Peace, O ſaies he, what an extraordinary bleſſing and mercy is this! Now God will ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raiſe the price of this Commodity from an ordinary, to an extraordinary bleſſing, and therefore he doth ſuffer his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and deereſt Servants to be thus diſcouraged, and their peace to be interrupted.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God is a tender Father, and he would have all the Love of his Children; he would not have his Children to love their Nurſe more than himſelf: Our Joy, and Peace, and Comfort, is but the Nurſe of our Graces; now when God ſees that his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall in love more with the Nurſe, than with himſelf, then he removes the Nurſe, and cauſes their Peace to be ſuſpended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted: he will not have the Nurſe to be loved more than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

                        </p>
                     </note> that he may train them up unto more perfection; Comfort is the Childrens Milk: ye may obſerve therefore, that the weaker Chriſtian hath ſomtimes more lively, ſenſible Comforts, than the ſtronger Chriſtian hath; Why? but becauſe this inward Joy, and Peace, and Comfort, is that Milk, and ſweet Honey whereby they are drawn off from the pleaſures and ſweetneſs of the world; and as theſe Comforts do wean us from the worlds comforts, ſo we have need to be weaned again from theſe weaners, which God doth ſomtimes by reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, and ſo we grow up unto more perfection.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Somtimes again, God ſees his Children do grow vain, and light, and froathy, and wanton, and ſecure under their Peace and Comfort, and then he withdraws himſelf, hides his face, and ſo they do loſe their Comfort. This was the caſe in <hi>Canticles,</hi> 5. where the Spouſe ſaith, <hi>My ſoul failed within me,</hi> at verſe 6. But why? <hi>I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himſelf:</hi> And why had he withdrawn himſelf? He comes and makes a tender of Love and Mercy, verſe 2. and ſhe would none,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102264:97"/> verſe 3. <hi>I have put off my Coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> that is, I am now laid to ſleep; they are words that import ſecurity, and upon her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity he withdraws himſelf, and being withdrawn, her ſoul fails within her. And thus it is many times with the Children of God in their particulars; the Lord ſees that they grow ſecure, vain, froathy, and wanton under their peace and comfort, then he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf, and their peace faileth.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, Our Lord and Savior Chriſt is a tender Chyrurgion, who hath ſet all our bones which we our ſelves have broken by our ſins.

                     </label> Much, very much, I ſhal not enter into the particulars. But how can they improve Chriſt as they ſhould in this condition? So long as a mans title for his land is in queſtion, he cannot ſow his ground, nor build houſes; and if you ask him, why do not you ſow your ground, and repair your houſes? his anſwer is ready, I dare not lay out much coſt, becauſe my title is in queſtion: So here, ſo long as a mans title to Chriſt is in queſtion, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not improve Chriſt as he ſhould. If a man be going a journy, and know not his way, he loſeth much of his way and of the comfort of it in inquiring after the way, and thinking whether he be right or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102264:99"/> wrong; when he comes at three or four turnings, there he ſtands whilſt he might ride a mile, and when he comes above in the field, and ſees a ſhephard at a diſtance from him, he rides up to him to inquire whether he be in his way or not; yea and al the day long he is thinking of his way, whether he be right; whereas if he knew his way, he might have many precious thoughts of God and of the word. So in this caſe, while a man is doubting and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and knows not whether he be in the way to Heaven or no, how much precious time is loſt? thoughts of Chriſt loſt? thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for Mercy loſt? of al hearts the ſcripture ſaith an unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart is an evil heart, and when mens hearts are diſcouraged and caſt down, are they not unbeleeving?

A man may have great deſire after ſome preferment, and place, which many ride for, but one is ſo haſty that he rides over hedg and ditch, and thereby fals, and hurts himſelf, ſo others get before him, and by his too much haſt, he doth loſe his place. Thus it is ſometimes with good people, they make ſo much haſt to their comfort, that they loſe it by their haſt, they would have it ſooner, if they went on in an ordinary way of waiting on God without ſuch poſting haſt, but they muſt have it to day, O! let me know my intereſt in Chriſt to day (ſaith one) or elſe I am undone for ever. Thus by ſtinting, and limiting God to a time, they tempt the holy one, and ſo are more diſtant from their comfort; the more the child cries, and is froward under the rod, the longer is the rod continued.</p>
                  <p>Some ſeek comfort in a way of reaſon, and think to reaſon out their temptation, and to reaſon in their comfort, but as one ſaith wel; diſpute not with God leſt you be confounded, diſpute not with Satan leſt you be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Some again tire themſelves in duty, neglecting of their calling; the truth is, prayer is a friend to comfort and more than ordinary time is to be uſed in prayer for thoſe that are troubled in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but when men under temptations, and without comforts throw up their callings, thinking that nothing is to be done but prayer, by throwing aſide their calling, they lay themſelves open to more temptations of Satan, they do ſo tire out their natural ſpirits in duty, that they are flat and dead in duty, ſo their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are the more increaſed, and their comforts more diſtanced. Wherefore conſider, if you would have comfort reſtored again, whether you do not uſe the means of comfort in ſuch a manner, as to ſet you at a further diſtance from it.</p>

I read of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> that when he was in horror of conſcience, he could not with peace and quietneſs behold his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for, to get an eſtate for them he denyed the truth, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they came before him in his trouble, he cryed out in much horror, How terrible is the ſight of theſe to me! they had been comforts to him before, yet now he could not away with the ſight of them, O! thought he, for your ſakes, and for your proviſion, I have denyed the truth and yeilded to theſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore ſayes he, How terrible is the ſight of theſe unto me? What peace or comfort had <hi>Judas</hi> in the ſight of his thirty pence? look what outward comfort a man ſtrains his conſcience for, that wil be death unto him to behold. We read of <hi>David</hi>

Time was heretofore when you had peace and comfort, and by ſtraining and ſtretching your conſcience for your outward comfort; now you have loſt your inward, wil you not then take that outward comfort, and pour it forth before the Lord? and ſay, God forbid that I ſhould drink the bloud of mine own peace and comfort, how can any of you have peace, while thoſe ſtollen, and unreſtored goods lye by you?</p>

Do as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court, and in great preferment, ſtanding in the preſence of the King, he went out to viſit his brethren, and to comfort them under their burdens, <hi>I wil ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>how it fares with my brethren, under their Burdens.</hi> So do you alſo, hath the Lord ſpoken peace and comfort to your ſoul? and do you now ſtand in the preſence of the King of Kings, having his face ſhining on you, with your comforts al reſtored unto you? now then go out unto your brethren, and inquire who they are that labor under any burden, and with the ſame comfort wherewith you have been comforted your ſelves, comfort others, knowing this for certain, that the more you ſpend, the more you ſhal have, and the longer you ſhal keep your comforts, yea, and this Chriſt expects, that what comforts we have from him, we ſhould ſpend for him.</p>

                     <hi>David</hi> had as much cauſe and reaſon for his diſcouragements here as any other, for he did want ordinances, yea he was kept from the ordinances, therefore ſaith he, verſ. 1.2. <hi>As the heart panteth after the water brookes, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God, my ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God, when ſhal I come and appear before God?</hi> yea after he had known the ſweetneſs of them he was deprived of them, verſ. 4. <hi>For I had gon with the multitude,</hi> I <hi>went with them to the houſe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102264:103"/> God.</hi> And in this condition he had many enemies, he was in the ſtate of affliction and perſecution, his enemies reproached him, they reproached him in the matter of his God, and that daily, verſ. 3. and 10. <hi>While they continually ſay unto me, where is thy God? As a ſword in my bones mine enemies reproach me, while they ſay daily unto me, where is thy God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he was now under great deſertions: though the enemies did reproach him in the matter of his God, yet if God had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him, he had been wel enough, but they ſaid, where is now thy God? and his own heart ſaid ſo too, that God had left and forſaken him, (which was his failing) verſ. 9. <hi>I wil ſay unto God my rock, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> yet for al this he ſaith, why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? As if he ſhould ſay, Thine enemies do not onely reproach thee in the matter of thy God, but thine own heart, thou art now kept from thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ordinances which once thou didſt enjoy, yet why ſhouldſt thou be diſquieted, or caſt down? there is no reaſon for it. So that the words ſpeak plainly this truth, A Godly, Gracious man hath no true ſcripture-reaſon for his diſcouragements whatever his condition be.</p>
                  <p>It was a ſad condition that the prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> did preſent unto himſelf, yet ſaith he, Chap. 3. <hi>I wil rejoyce in the Lord, I wil joy in the God of my Salva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

But O thou ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, thou art now under a threatening, and not under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which makes thy very belly to tremble, and wilt thou, canſt thou now rejoyce? yes ſaith he, verſ. 16. <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lipps quivered at the voice, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs entred into my bones, yet wil I rejoyce in the Lord &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it may be thou thinkeſt this threatening wil never be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Yes ſaith he, verſ. the 17. <hi>Although the figg-tree ſhal not bloſſom, neither ſhal fruit be in the vines, the labour of the Olive ſhal fail, and the field ſhal yeild no meat, the flock ſhal be cut off from the fold, and there ſhal be no meat in the ſtalls, yet wil I rejoyce in the Lord &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a man may rejoyce though he have no wine to drink, or olive to eat, becauſe theſe are but creatures which are for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; but wilt thou rejoyce (O Prophet) if thou wanteſt thy daily bread, and ſuch creatures as are for our daily nouriſhment?</p>
                  <p>Yes (ſaith he) <hi>Although the field ſhal yeild no meat, and the flock ſhal be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the ſtall,</hi> yet wil I rejoyce in the Lord. So that whatever a Godly mans condition be, he may rejoyce, and there is no true reaſon for his diſcouragement.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, there is no ſin ſo unreaſonable, but the ſinner thinks he hath reaſon for it, and ſo the Saints and people of God may think,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102264:103"/> that they have reaſon for their diſcouragements, hence it is that they have ſo many <hi>why's</hi> and <hi>wherefores, Why haſt thou forſaken me? why go I mourning?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, they may not onely ſeem to have ſome reaſon, but in a way of nature, they have reaſon for their diſcouragements: and therefore ſaith <hi>David, When I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſaid, I have cleanſed my hands in vain, til I went into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> So that, ſo long as he was in the houſe of nature, and natural reaſon, he did ſee reaſon for his diſcouragement.</p>
                  <p>Yea, not only ſo, but take things aſunder, and conſider things by pieces, one from another, abſtracting the means from the end, and ſo the Saints may have a true and real reaſon for their diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, for every affliction is Grievous. If the husbandman look only upon the breaking up of his ground, without reſpect to the harveſt, he may wel be diſcouraged, but take both together, and ſo he wil not: thus if the Saints conſider their breakings apart from their harveſt, they may ſee cauſe for their diſcouragements: but if they do conſider their breaking up, and their harveſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the means and the end together, I ſay take altogether, and then, whatever their condition be, they have no reaſon to be caſt down, or be diſquieted.</p>

True ſaith God, ye cannot in, and by your ſelves, but there I wil ſpeak friendly and comfortably to her, and of al the times that I chuſe to preach Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to a poor ſoul, I chuſe to do it in a wilderneſſed and loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But though the Lord do ſpeak comfortably to us, if we be in a wilderneſs, a dry &amp; barren place where no food, nor comfort is, how can we be but diſcouraged? Nay (ſaith the Lord) but <hi>I wil give her her vinyards from thence:</hi> But if we ſin &amp; murmur in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the Iſraelites did, the Lord wil cut us off as he did them, &amp; a wilderneſs is a place of trouble, wherein we are apt to murmur, &amp; be diſcouraged: Nay (ſaith the Lord) but I wil give her her vinyards from thence, and the vally of <hi>Achor</hi> for a door of hope. The valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> was the valley of Perturbation, trouble, and of great diſcouragement, when the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſled, and fel before the men of <hi>Ai,</hi> for the ſin of <hi>Achan, Joſhua,</hi> 7. verſ. the laſt; yet it was an in-let to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> to the Land of reſt. Now ſaith the Lord, look as it was with them, though the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> was a Valley of Trouble and Perturbation, yet it was the door by which the Iſraelites came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of Reſt: So ſhall it be with you, I will make your Troubles and Diſcouragements, the very door of your Hope; the Valley of your Diſcouragements ſhall be the door, and an in-let unto all your Reſt and Comfort. God takes the ſame way with the Members, as he went with the Head; Chriſts Croſs an in-let of Glory, his ſuffering time was the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and was it not a door of Hope unto them, and unto all the Saints?

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102264:107"/> of men in the world, that have the Law of God in their hearts, though they cannot act and work towards God as they would; theſe ſomtimes are in a dry, and barren condition, where no Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Comfort is; yet if in this condition, they dig up pits, go to prayer, wait upon God in Duty, though they find no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſpringing up in their Duty for the preſent, yet in due time, the rain of Gods Bleſſing will fill thoſe dry pits, and empty duties, whereby their Life ſhall be like unto a Pool of Water, and they ſhall go from ſtrength of Grace, to ſtrength of Grace, till they ſee the Lord. Know ye therefore, any man that is in this Valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> where no Water is, yet if he can find in his heart to dig up pits, to pray, read, hear, meditate, confer, and perform Duties, though thoſe duties be empty of Comfort for the preſent, yet the rain of Grace and Mercy ſhall fall upon thoſe Pits, and he ſhall go from ſtrength to ſtrength, till he appears before the Lord in Glory. Now thus it is with the Saints, though darkneſs, and a great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be upon them, yet in that dark condition they are ſtill digging up pits, and therefore this darkneſs is not the darkneſs of the night, but the darkneſs of a cloud, and they may ſay, this is a cloudy darkneſs, and it wil over ere long.</p>

You know that when <hi>David</hi> fled from <hi>Abſolon,</hi> he was in a dark condition, for the Text ſaith, <hi>He went, and he wept,</hi> and he went bare-foot; his own ſon perſecutes him, drives him from his Throne, a great conſederacy was raiſed againſt him by wicked men, with the child of his own bowels; here was darkneſs upon darkneſs, matter of great diſcouragement, but it was a cloud, and no more.</p>
                  <p>You wil ſay, <hi>How ſhould</hi> David <hi>have known that it was but the darkneſs of a cloud?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>David</hi> prayed, <hi>The Lord turn the Counſels of</hi> Ahithophel <hi>into folly;</hi> and before <hi>David</hi> had overcome <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his Kingdom, <hi>Ahithophel</hi> did hang himſelf: <hi>David</hi> ſingled out <hi>Ahithophel</hi> to pray againſt, and the Lord heard his prayer: that Judgment of <hi>Ahithophel</hi> was the return of <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer; here the cloud opened, and this Anſwer of his Prayer in the interim, was a Seal to <hi>David</hi> of the full deliverance that came afterwards,<note place="margin">Deus uno Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillo Sigillat diverſas mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias.</note> for God ſeals divers matters with the ſame Seal.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102264:107"/> before the full deliverance comes, he hath ſome leſſer deliverance, that leſſer deliverance in the interim, is a Seal unto him of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliverance, and he may ſay, here is a pledg of my full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, for here is the opening of the cloud. Now thus it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with the People of God; they never are in any affliction, temptation, or deſertion, but before their great deliverance comes, they have ſome ſpecial Providence, ſome reviving in the midſt of their trouble, ſome interim of light, ſome openings of the cloud; and therefore in the midſt of all they may ſay, ſurely this my dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not the darkneſs of a night, but of a cloud; I ſay, there is no diſcouragement doth befall the Saints, but the matter thereof is a cloud, and they may ſay, it is but a cloud, it will paſs over, and therefore why ſhould they be diſcouraged? Surely there is no reaſon for their diſcouragements whatever their condition be.</p>
                  <p>If theſe things be ſo,<note place="margin">Applic.</note> How heavily doth this Doctrine fall in reproof upon ſome, I wiſh I might not ſay, ſome of the Servants and People of God: A godly man hath no true reaſon for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements whatever his condition is, although it be never ſo ſad; and ſome are alwaies diſcouraged whatever their condition be, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be never ſo good; whatever falls out, the Saints ſhould not be diſcouraged, no not at any thing, and yet many are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at every thing, and upon every occaſion.

Are you accuſed by Satan, world, or your own conſcience? He is called your Advocate: Are you ignorant? He is called the Prophet. Are you guilty of

He is our ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> a publick perſon, in whoſe death we dyed, and in whoſe ſatisfaction we ſatiſfyed; As there is no Temptation or affliction, but ſome promiſe or other doth eſpecially ſute there withal; So there is no condition, but ſome Name, ſome Title, ſome Attribute of Chriſt doth eſpecially ſute with it: and as you do not look on Chriſt, but in reference to your condition, ſo you are not to look upon your condition alone, but with Chriſts Attribute ſutable thereunto; if you look upon Chriſts Attribute of love without your condition, you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; if on your condition without Chriſts Attribute of love, you may deſpair: think on both together &amp; you wil not be diſcouraged.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If your diſcouragements begin to ariſe and preſs in upon you, check your ſelf and ſay, why ſhould I multiply thoughts without knowledg? why ſhould I tire out my ſoul with theſe thoughts? am I able to ad one cubit to my ſpiritual ſtate? am I by al my thoughtfulneſs able to alter my condition? yea, doth not my thoughtfulneſs ſet me at a farther diſtance from the mercy deſired? The truth is, the only way to loſe the comfort deſired, is to be ſollicitous about it: as the only way to have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſing is to be content to go without it; So the only way to have a ſpiritual or outward affliction removed, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented that it ſhould be continued, if God and Chriſt wil have it ſo. But you wil have your affliction preſently removed, and you muſt preſently know that you are in the ſtate of Grace, and the child of God, or elſe you wil be diſcouraged, and as the bird in the net, the more it ſtrives, the more it is intangled; ſo with you alſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do temptations, afflictions, deſertions come, and Satan joyn with them, and ſay unto thy ſoul, this wil ever be? anſwer, wel, but I therefore beleeve the contrary, becauſe thou ſayeſt ſo Satan, who art a Lyar, yet if God wil have it ſo, I am contented, I leave it to him: whether I ſhal ever be in this condition or not, is not my queſtion, but now O Lord, let me ſerve thee, that is al my deſire, let me ſee thee as thou pleaſeſt, when thou pleaſeſt. I have done, Lord I have done, I have been queſtioning, and queſtioning my condition theſe many years, I ſee there is no end of that, yea, the more I do, the more I may, I get nothing by it, why therefore, O my ſoul, ſhould I tear out my ſelf with this kind of thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? thus check your ſelves.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, When ever you think of any thing which is in it ſelf terrible, or matter of diſcouragement, be ſure that you mingle the

There is nothing terrible, but God hath joyned ſome comfortable thing with it: the Name of God is terrible, he is called the great and dreadful God; but to ſweeten this, he is called the God of all Conſolations: Death is terrible, it's called the King of Terrors; but to ſweeten this, it is called a Sleep: The day of Judgment is terrible; but to ſweeten that, our preſent Advocate ſhal be our future Judg; yea, our beſt Friend, and our dear Husband. Now if you abſtract the terror of any Object from the ſweetneſs of it, no wonder if you be much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. It is our Duty to behold things as God preſents them, and to take things as God doth give them. What God hath joyned together, no man may put aſunder. If you conſider the ſweetneſs of an Object or Condition, without the ſowrneſs of it, then you may grow too wanton: if you conſider the terror of an Object or Condition, without the ſweetneſs of it, then you may be too fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: But if you think on both together, then you will fear, and beleeve; and beleeve, and fear, and ſo be kept from Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

O but I am diſcouraged, becauſe I have no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Well, but ſuppoſe you had aſſurance, what then? then I ſhould have Comfort: And is not here Self? O but I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged about my everlaſting Condition. And is not that Self? doth not that word <hi>Condition</hi> ſound ones Self? I dare boldly ſay, there is no tumult or immoderate Diſcouragement in the ſoul, but hath Self at the bottom. Could I leave my ſelf, and my Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God and Chriſt, and mind his Service, Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor more, God would take care of my Comfort: but when I mind my ſelf, and my condition ſo much, and his Service, Glory, and Honor ſo little, no wonder that I am ſo much diſcouraged. Therefore labor more and more to mortifie ſelf-love, and ſo ſhall you never be diſcouraged whatever your condition be.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly: In caſe that Temptation preſs in upon you, and urge you to ſad Diſcouragements, ſpeak to this purpoſe unto your own ſoul. Why ſhould I buy my Repentance at ſo dear a rate? There is none of all theſe doubtings, unbeleeving fears, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but you will be aſhamed and repent of afterwards. You know how it is with the Traveller, he thinks the Sun is not yet up, and ſo he loyters, and ſits down; but the Sun creeping up behind the cloud, at laſt breaks out upon his face, and is got before him, and then he ſaies, O what a fool was I to think the Sun was not

So it will be with you, you now lie down upon the Earth, and your belly cleaves to the duſt by reaſon of your Diſcouragements; but the Grace of God, and the Love of Chriſt, is creeping up behind the dark cloud, and it will break out at the laſt upon you, and ſhine into your face with the Golden beams of mercy, it will prevent you, and be before you; and then you wil ſay, O what a fool was I to be thus diſcouraged, what an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Creature I, to doubt thus of Gods Love; I have ſinned, I have ſinned by all my unbeleef: now the Lord pardon me all my doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, I am O Lord, aſhamed of theſe my doubtings and queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of thy Love, pardon them O Lord unto my ſoul. This is that which you muſt come to, you muſt at laſt be aſhamed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of theſe your unbeleefs, doubtings, and fears, and therefore when-ever they preſs in upon thee, ſay at the firſt unto thy ſelf, Why ſhould I buy my Repentance at ſo dear a rate, by yielding unto theſe Diſcouragements? And for this very reaſon, becauſe that Diſcouragements are to be repented of, Therefore the Saints and People of God have no reaſon to be diſcouraged whatever their Condition be.</p>

The thing is true, though the expreſſion be ſtrange; Chriſt was made ſin for Saints, therefore their ſin ſhall not hurt them. It ſtands not with the Juſtice of God to exact the payment of one debt twice. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath not only been arreſted, but in Goal for the debt of the Saints and People of God, and he hath paid it to the utmoſt farthing, he hath paid it better than they could have paid it themſelves, if they had gone to Hell: for if a Godly man had gone to Hell, and been damned for ever, he would have been alwaies paying, but the debt would never have been paid: Chriſt paid it all down for the preſent. And if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scripture, you will find, That the Lord doth not condemn a man, no not a wicked man, barely for the act of his former ſin, but becauſe he wil not turn from it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. <hi>The Lord is angry with the wicked every day:</hi> verſe 12. <hi>If he turn not, he will whet his Sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready; he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for him the Inſtruments of death, he ordaineth his Arrows againſt the Perſecutor:</hi> The Lord hath prepared Inſtruments of Death againſt every wicked man; but yet notwithſtanding, though a man be never ſo wicked, if he turn unto the Lord, God will not diſcharge thoſe Inſtruments of Death upon him, yea, though his ſins have been never ſo great; but, ſaith the Text, If he turn not (not becauſe he hath ſinned before only, but becauſe he turns not from his ſin) he will whet his Sword; he hath bent his Bow, and made it ready. Now there is alwaies in the Saints and People of God, a turning diſpoſition, although they do ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; there is alwaies (I ſay) a turning diſpoſition in them, and therefore the Lord will not diſcharge the Inſtruments of death upon them, ſurely then, they have no reaſon to be quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in this reſpect.</p>

Now mark it, and you ſhall find, That God doth never ſuffer his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102264:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> to fall into any ſin, but he intends to make that ſin an in-let un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to further Grace and Comfort to them. This ye ſee in the firſt great Sin that ever was committed by the Children of Men, the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord himſelf came and preached the Goſpel, preached Chriſt unto fallen Man; and ſurely when God himſelf preached the Goſpel, we are to think the man was converted: Now the greateſt Bleſſing that ever the World ſaw, was the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; but how came that about? God ſuffers man to fall, and mans Unrighteouſneſs, muſt uſher in Chriſts Righteouſneſs. The Scripture tells us, that the Lord ſuffered <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to fall, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might know all that was in his heart; he did not know his own heart before, and therefore the Lord let him fall that he might know his own heart. But if you look into the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 11. you ſhall find in ſo many words, what I am now ſpeaking, verſe 32. <hi>For God hath conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them all in unbeleef;</hi> Why? <hi>That he might have mercy upon all.</hi> O! what a bleſſed deſign upon Unbeleef is here! Therefore God concludes all under Unbeleef, that he might have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all: Sin gets not, but is a loſer by every fall of the Godly. And if ye look into the Scripture, ye ſhall obſerve, That when the People of God fall, uſually they fail in that Grace, wherein they do moſt excel; and wherein they did moſt excel, therein they did moſt miſcarry. <hi>Abraham</hi> did moſt excel in Faith, and therein he did moſt miſcarry: <hi>Moſes</hi> did moſt excel in Meekneſs, and therein he did moſt miſcarry; we read of no other ſin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Moſes,</hi> but his Anger: <hi>Job</hi> did moſt excel in Patience, and therein he did moſt miſcarry: <hi>Peter</hi> did moſt excel in Zeal, and Reſolution for Chriſt <hi>(Though all the World for ſake thee, yet will not I)</hi> and therein he did moſt miſcarry: denying Chriſt at the voyce of a Damzel. I ſay ye ſhall obſerve this, That the Saints fell, and failed in that Grace wherein they did moſt excel; and they did moſt excel, wherein they did moſt miſcarry: what's the Reaſon of this? but becauſe the Lord by the over-ruling hand of his Grace, did make their very miſcarriages, in-lets and occaſions to their further Grace and Holineſs. God hath a great Revenue from the very infirmities of his People. He doth never ſuffer any of his People to fall into any ſin, but he hath a deſign by that fall, to break the back of that ſin they do fall into. Now then, have the Saints and People of God, any reaſon to be diſcouraged in this reſpect? By their ſin they may be, and are often times ſuſpended from their Comforts, and uſe of their Priviledges; but by their ſin, they do not loſe their right thereunto. Ye know how it was with the Leper in the times of the Old Teſtament, among the Jews; when he was carried out of the City or Town from his own Houſe, by reaſon of his uncleanneſs: Or now, if a man that hath the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102264:114"/> Plague, and be carried from his own Houſe by reaſon thereof; the Leper then, and the man that hath the Plague, or the Peſt now, may ſay, Though I be removed from mine own Houſe, and have not the uſe of my Houſe, yet I have a right to my Houſe ſtill; and though I cannot come to the uſe of my Land, yet I have a Right to my Land ſtill. So a Godly man may ſay as concerning his ſin; This ſin of mine indeed, it is a Peſt, and the Plague of my Soul, and a Leproſy; but though by this Leproſy of mine, I am now ſuſpended from the uſe of my Comforts, yea, from the full uſe of my Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; yet notwithſtanding, I have an Intereſt in Chriſt ſtill, I have not loſt my Intereſt, ſtill I have Right to Chriſt; although I cannot come to the uſe of him as I did before, yet I have right unto Jeſus Chriſt now, as I had before: And if all theſe things be ſo, Why ſhould a godly man be caſt down, or diſcouraged in this reſpect? Surely he ought not to be ſo.</p>

                  <p>Yet further; it is obſerved, that though the Lord did ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cal <hi>David</hi> his ſervant, yet when <hi>David</hi> had ſinned that great ſin, he ſent the prophet to him ſaying, <hi>Go ſay to David,</hi> he had loſt the title of ſervant, now bare <hi>David,</hi> now ſingle <hi>David,</hi> now <hi>David</hi> without the title my ſervant.

Thus, I ſay, the ſins of Gods own people do deprive them, and diveſt them of their ſpiritual priviledges, and can a gracious heart look upon this, and conſider how he is diveſted and diſrobed of his ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and not mourn under it? Can one friend grieve another friend, and not be grieved himſelf? The Saints by their ſins they grieve God, who is their beſt friend, and therefore certainly they muſt needs be grieved, they muſt needs be humbled, or there is no Grace, not grieved, not humbled, not Gracious.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, When a man is humbled, truly humbled, the object of his grief, ſorrow or trouble, is ſin it ſelf, as a diſhonor done unto God: the object of diſcouragement is a mans own condition, or ſin in order to his own condition, the ultimate object of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being a mans own condition when a man is diſcouraged, you ſhal find ſtil, that his trouble runs al out upon his own condition, O! ſaith a diſcouraged perſon, I have ſinned, I have thus ſinned, and therefore my condition is naught, and if my condition be naught now, it wil never be better, Lord, what wil become of my ſoul? Stil his trouble is about his own condition. But when a man is grieved and truly humbled for ſin, his trouble is about ſin it ſelf, as a diſhonor done unto God. To clear this by ſcripture, you know <hi>Cain</hi> was diſcouraged, but <hi>Cain</hi> was not humbled: how may that appear? Cain was troubled about his condition
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102264:117"/> Ah! ſaith he, <hi>My puniſhment is greater than I can bear.</hi> on the other ſide, the poor prodigal was humbled, but not diſcouraged: how may that appear? his trouble was about his ſin, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his condition: <hi>I wil return unto my Father,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I wil ſay unto him, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and</hi> I <hi>am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired ſervants. David</hi> ſometimes was both diſcouraged and humbled, and then you find his repentance and humiliation to be very brackiſh: but if you look into the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. you ſhal find <hi>David</hi> humbled, but not diſcouraged, for it is a penitential Pſalm, therefore humbled and not diſcouraged, for ſtil he did keep his Aſſurance, verſ. 14. <hi>Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs O God, thou God of my Salvation.</hi> But what was his repentance, his trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout? It was about his ſin, and not about his condition, read verſ. 23. and ſo on, <hi>Waſh me throughly from mine iniquity, and clenſe me from my ſin, for</hi> I <hi>acknowledg my tranſgreſſion, and my ſin is ever before me, Againſt thee, thee only have</hi> I <hi>ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight: Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> ſtil ye ſee his eye is upon his ſin, and not upon his condition only; So that I ſay, when a man is truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and grieved for ſin, the object of his grief is ſin, as a diſhonor done unto God: when a man is diſcouraged and not humbled, then his trouble is al about his condition, and what wil become of him.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, True humiliation, it is no enemy, but a real friend unto ſpiritual joy, to our rejoyceing in God. The more a man is humbled for ſin committed, the more he wil rejoyce in God, and rejoyce that he can grieve for Sin: He grieves, and rejoyceth that he can grieve for ſin. therefore humiliation (by our Savior Chriſt) is made an effect of the comforter. I <hi>wil ſend the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he ſhal convince the world of ſin,</hi> becauſe there is comfort alwaies goes along with true humiliation, it is not an enemy but a friend to our ſpiritual rejoycing; but diſcouragement is an enemy to ſpiritual joy; A man that is diſcouraged, is grieved, and he is ſad upon his grief, and if ye tel him that he muſt rejoyce in God, and cal upon him to rejoyce in God, O! no, ſaith he, it is not for me to rejoyce, I am a man of another diſpoſition, joy doth not belong to me, or to one in my condition: But now when a man is truly humbled, the more he is humbled for Sin, the more he can rejoyce in God, but the more a man is diſcouraged, the leſs he rejoyceth in God.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, The more a man is humbled, truly humbled for Sin, the more he is found in Duty; the more a man is diſcouraged, the more his hands are weakened to Duty: As it is with the Water, if the Water do continue in its true ſtream, it doth not over-flow
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102264:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Banks, it doth not break down the Dam: Somtimes you have a great fall of Water, a great and mighty flood, and then the River over-flows the Banks, and the Water bears down the Dam. So here; Duty is the Bank of Sorrow, Grief, and Humiliation for Sin; I ſay, your Duties are the Banks of all your Godly Sorrow, and when a mans Sorrow, or Grief, doth ariſe to ſuch an height, that it ſwels over Duty, and a man ſaith, I will pray no more, it is to no purpoſe; and I will hear no more, for there is no hope for my ſoul; and I will examine my own heart no more: when thus Sorrow ſwels over Duty, and breaks down the Dam of Duty, then it is Diſcouragement, it is not Humiliation: be not miſtaken, this is not Humiliation, this is a plain Diſcouragement. There is a great difference then between Diſcouragement and Humiliation: Many People indeed do call their Diſcouragements, Humiliation; but the Lord knows, there is not a drop of Humiliation in a flood of Diſcouragement: Would you therefore be humbled? O then, be not diſcouraged; for the more you are diſcouraged, the leſs you will be humbled; and the more humbled you are, the leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged you wil be.</p>

                     <hi>But if there be ſuch a great difference between theſe, and if it be our Duty, to be humbled for ſin, but not to be diſcouraged; What ſhould a man do to bear up his heart to the work of Humiliation, and yet bear up againſt all Diſcouragement? How ſhall I be ſo humbled as I may not be diſcouraged? or what ſhal a man do that he may be humbled, and yet not be diſcouraged in his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>

Both theſe parts are true: A man is not to be diſcouraged under his ſin, although it be never ſo great; becauſe Diſcouragement it ſelf is a ſin, and that cannot help againſt ſin, Sin cannot help againſt ſin. A man is to be humbled for his ſin, although it be never ſo ſmal, for it is a diſhonor to God, and little ſins make way to great ſins. So then, if thou would'ſt be humbled, and not diſcouraged, carry this Rule up and down with you, and alwaies remember it upon all occaſions: It is my Duty, and I have reaſon to be humbled for my ſin, although it be never ſo ſmal; but I have no reaſon to be diſcouraged under my ſin, though it be never ſo great.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102264:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> Promiſe of Aſſiſtance, a Promiſe of Acceptance, and a Promiſe of Reward. If you look upon the Commandement it ſelf without the Promiſe, then you will deſpair; if you look upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe without the Commandement, then you will preſume: But look upon Promiſe and Commandement, Commandement and Promiſe together, then ye will be humbled, in caſe ye have ſinned, but ye wil not be diſcouraged. The Lord you know hath given two Eyes to man, and if a man ſhould put out one, and ſay, I can ſee well enough with the other, what need I have two? he ſhould ſin greatly. So for the ſoul, the Lord hath given two eyes, as I may ſo ſpeak; the eye of Conſcience, which is to look upon Gods Commandement; and the eye of Faith, which is to look upon Gods Promiſe: and if any man will ſay; I will put out the eye of Faith, I can ſee well enough with the Eye of Conſcience upon Gods Commandement, he ſhal do ill, and very ill: and if a man ſhall ſay, I will put out the Eye of Conſcience, for I can ſee well enough with the Eye of Faith, he ſhal do very ill. But whenever you find you have ſinned againſt any Commandement, preſently ſay, Where is the Promiſe? I may not look upon the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement without the Promiſe, nor the Promiſe without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Thus joyn both together, and you ſhall not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged; yet be humbled.</p>

Humiliation (you have heard) is objectated upon Sin it ſelf, as a diſhonor to God; the Object of our Humiliation is Sin it ſelf, as a diſhonor done unto God: but now the Object of our Diſcouragement (you have heard) is our Condition, only our Condition. Well then, would you be humbled ſo as you may not be diſcouraged? take heed that you do not ſtand poring only upon your Condition; but rather ſay thus unto thine own ſoul; O my ſoul, thou haſt been much miſtaken (the Lord pardon it) for all this queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hath been about thy Condition, and what will become of thee, and if at any time thou haſt grieved for Sin, it hath been in order to thy condition, becauſe thy condition is naught, and becauſe thou did'ſt not know what ſhould become of thee: but now if thou would'ſt be truly humbled, and not be diſcouraged, then lay aſide a little the thoughts of your own condition, and pitch upon ſin as a breach of Gods Law, a tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor done to God, and as a breach of the Law of Love between Chriſt and you. Thus I ſay, if you would be humbled, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, rather mourn over your Condition in order to your Sin, than for your Sin in order to your Condition.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> Fourthly: In your Humiliation, take heed that you do not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102264:119"/> meddle too much with Gods Prerogative, and with Gods Peculiar. In Humiliation, a man is to meddle with that which belongs to man: Some things there are that are peculiar to God, and are his Prerogative. You ſee how it is with the Birds of the Air; ſo long as the Birds fly up and down here in the Air, they do live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably; but if the Birds do fly up to the Element of Fire, it wil burn their Wings, and they will fall down head-long. So here, ſo long as a man in his Humiliation keeps within his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and Element, he may walk comfortably there; but if a man in Humiliation, will ſoar up unto Gods Prerogative, certainly his Soul wil fal down upon the Earth, and be much diſcouraged. Now I pray, what is more the Prerogative and Peculiar of God than this, To know who is a Reprobate, and who is not? When a man is humbled and grieved about his Sin, and he finds that he hath ſinned much againſt God, and thereupon he concludes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Reprobate, is not this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o come upon Gods Prerogative? The Scripture tels a man indeed, what he is for the preſent, That a man for the preſent is a Drunkard, or a Swearer, or a Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, or an Adulterer; and therefore the Scripture tels him for the preſent, that he is in the ſtate of Nature, and under the wrath of God; but doth the Scripture tel him that he is a Reprobate, that he can never be converted and turned to God? Surely this is Gods great Prerogative to know, his Secret which he reſerves to himſelf, and therefore when a man goes to be humbled before God, and concludes, O! I am a Reprobate, and there is no hope for me, and I ſhal never be converted; this is to ſoar too high into Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and he wil burn his wings, and he wil fal down into great Diſcouragement. Therefore in al your Humiliation, take heed that you do not fal upon any thing that is the Peculiar and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God, for then you wil not be humbled, but diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>

When you come to Humiliation, you are humbled, becauſe you have ſinned againſt God; but how do you preſent this God to your own ſoul? Do you preſent him as a Judg only? or as a Father alſo? Do you preſent the Lord unto your ſoul only under the Notion or Attribute of his Greatneſs, or under the Notion and Attribute of his Goodneſs alſo? <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid thus: <hi>When my heart is brisk and jolly, I preſent God unto my ſelf under the notion of his Greatneſs; but when my heart is low and fearing, then I preſent God to me under the notion of his Goodneſs: One while I conſider Chriſt as my Example, another while as my Gift: when my heart is too high, then I conſider Chriſt as my Example; when my ſpirit is too low, I conſider Chriſt as my Gift.</hi> So do you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102264:119"/> alſo. I know you wil ſay, I cannot ſomtimes preſent the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſoul under the notion of a Father, becauſe I have no aſſurance of his Love. Yet you may conſider the Lord as gracious in himſelf, as good in himſelf, and loving in himſelf, and ſay, I have thus and thus Sinned againſt a gracious God, and although thou haſt not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods Love to thee in Particular, yet if you can preſent God to your ſoul, under the Notion of his general Goodneſs, as good in himſelf, you will never be diſcouraged, but be humbled.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>6</label> Sixtly, and laſtly: If you would be truly humbled, and not be diſcouraged; not diſcouraged, and yet humbled; then beat and drive up all your ſins to your unbeleef, and lay the ſtreſs and weight of all your ſorrow upon that Sin. As in matter of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, if a man do run up every Mercy, unto the Fountain Mercy, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, he wil be moſt thankful: So in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Humiliation, If a man do run up every Sin, unto the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Head Sin, he wil be moſt humbled. Now what is the great Sin, the Fountain Sin, the Head Sin of al your Sins, but Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief? and beleeve it, he is never far from Faith, that is humbled for his Unbeleef, and he wil never be diſcouraged that is not far from Faith. Now therefore, if at any time you find your ſoul in any Sin, then ſay, This hath my Unbeleef done, I did not think that I had had ſuch an unbeleeving heart; O! what an unbeleeving heart have I! This, even all this Sin hath my Unbeleef brought forth. Now the Lord heal my unbeleeving heart. A ſoul grieved for unbeleef, wil never be diſcouraged too much, nor be humbled too little, he wil be humbled in truth for ſin, becauſe he is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for his unbeleef, which is the mother Sin; yet he wil not be diſcouraged, becauſe he is humbled for that which doth cauſe al diſcouragements. Lay therefore the weight of your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon this Sin, and you ſhal be truly humbled without unjuſt diſcouragement. And thus I have diſpatched the firſt particular, by al which you ſee, That a Gracious, Godly man, though he hath juſt cauſe for humiliation, yet he hath no juſt and ſcripture rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be diſcouraged for his Sin: though he have Sinned, and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greatly, yet no diſcouragement is to grow upon this condition.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, And if a Chriſtian would be diſcouraged, if he did not ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find a weakneſs and ſmalneſs of Grace within him; then he hath no reaſon to be diſcouraged, becauſe he doth find this weakneſs.

So is the Goſpel, both in the preaching, and the effect of it: it begins low, and is very little at the firſt; and therefore, if a man ſhould not find his Grace to be ſmal at the firſt, he would doubt whether ever the Kingdom of Heaven were in him or no, ſaying, The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed, the leaſt of all Seeds; but I have not found it ſo in my ſoul, I have not found this littleneſs and ſmalneſs of Grace, and

                     </label> No: Here is reaſon indeed, why you ſhould be afflicted, but no reaſon yet, why you ſhould be diſcouraged. I confeſs indeed, here is cauſe and reaſon of grief, and of affliction; for take Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, (to inſtance only in that) and, it is, That act and work of the ſoul, whereby a man doth converſe with God; God conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with man, and man with God. And is it not a ſore affliction, for a poor creature to be ſhut out of Gods door, ſuch a freind as God is? O! ſaith <hi>Chriſoſtome,</hi> it is more bitter than death, to be ſpoiled of Prayer: and hereupon, (as he obſerves) <hi>Daniel</hi> choſe rather, to run the hazard of his life, than to loſe his Prayer. Prayer is the ſouls Weapon; and is it not a grief, to want a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in our ſpiritual warfare? Prayer is the ſouls Ornament, the excellent Garment of a Chriſtian; and is it not an affliction, to be without this Garment, and to be found naked? Prayer is the Chriſtians Element; And as the fiſh lives in the water, as in its Element, and dyes when it is out, ſo a Chriſtian lives in prayer as in his Element, and his heart dies when he is out of it. Prayer is the ſouls Proviſioner; fetcheth in Proviſion for the ſoul, and for al its Graces: The old bird, the Dam, goes abroad and fetcheth in meat for the young ones, and they lye in the neſt gaping, to receive the meat upon its return; and if the old one be kild a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the young ones wil die preſently at home. So here, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goes abroad, and fetcheth in proviſion for al our Graces, and they al lye gaping, to receive this proviſion from the mouth of Prayer; if this be killed, how can thoſe other Graces live? The truth is, The more ſweetneſs a Chriſtian finds in any work, the greater is his affliction, if he want that work; now what abundance of ſweetneſs, doth a Gracious ſoul find in Prayer? therefore when a man is narrowed, or ſhut up in Prayer, it cannot but be a great affliction to him. But though it be a matter of great affliction, yet a good man, hath no reaſon to be quite diſcouraged, yea, though he meet with many failings therein, and cannot pray as he would, nor perform duty as he ſhould.</p>

Now, in this great Charter, the Lord doth proclaim this, That ſincerity ſhal go for perfection; That a little done for God, in the time of temptation, ſhal be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much. In this great Charter, the Lord doth proclaim unto al his people, That he doth rather regard the bent of the heart, than the inlargment of the heart: That he dorh rather regard the wil to do, than the doing. In this great Charter, the Covenant of free Grace, the Lord proclaims unto al his people, That if they do fail in prayer, and other duties, (for I ſpeak not of prayer only, though I inſtance in that) He wil not caſt them off, but he wil rather be moved to pity them; for the Covenant that the Lord makes with his people, is as the Covenant that a man makes with his wife, <hi>I wil betroth thee unto me, for ever,</hi> ſaith the Lord.<note place="margin">

Again; in this great Charter, and Covenant of Grace, the Lord doth proclaim unto al his Children, That what they want in performance, he wil make up in indulgence. He proclaims this unto them, That he wil require no more, than he gives; he wil give what he requires, and he wil accept what he gives. Now therefore, am I in that Covenant of Grace? and are there many failings in al my duties? yet if this be true, That the Lord is more moved by my failings to pity me, than to caſt me off, then I have no reaſon for to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: And thus it is with every child of God, he is in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and ſo the Priviledges, and Immunities of al this great Charter, belongs unto him.</p>

So here, God intends to give us a mercy in the way of Prayer, and he ſets us a praying for it, and we think we obtain it by the ſtrength of our own prayer, as if we did move, and change the will of God by our Duty: but all the enlargements in the world, make no alteration in the will of God; he is immovable, unchangable, and the ſame for ever: But he will give out his bleſſings in a way of prayer, therefore it is our Duty to pray, yet we muſt not be diſcouraged though we cannot pray as we would.</p>

Prayer is the powring out of the ſoul to God; not the powring out of words, not the powring out of expreſſions; but the powring out of the ſoul to God. Words many times, and expreſſions, are a great way off from the ſoul; but ſighs and groans are next the ſoul, and have more of the ſoul in them, than words and expreſſions many times have: now thou complaineſt, that thy heart is ſtraightened, and dead, and dull; but when you are ſo ſtraightened in Prayer, do ye not at that time powr out ſighs and groans after Prayer? ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O! what freedom once I had, O! Lord, that I might have the like freedom again. And whereas you ſay now, that your heart is hardened in Duty; conſider, whether there be not a great miſtake about hardneſs, and ſoftneſs of heart: <hi>Durum eſt quod tactui non cedit molle cedit;</hi> A hard thing doth not yield to the touch, but a ſoft thing doth.

It were an incivility, you wil ſay, when a Petitioner hath gotten the Kings Ear, for the poor Petitioner, then to turn his back upon the King: and what an evil muſt it needs be, when a poor ſoul hath gotten the Ear of God, then to turn the back by way of diſtractions upon the Lord, who comes down to hear his Prayer.

A man doth ſomtimes open a door for one of worth, and others preſs and croud in with him; and if the Maſter ſay to his Servant, why did you let all theſe men in? he anſwers, Sir, I did not open the door for theſe, but for another, and theſe did preſs and troud in upon me, and I could not hinder; then is the Maſter ſatisfied, and the Servant excuſed. So in this caſe it is, and that often, with the People of God; Chriſt ſtands at their door and knocks, they run to meet with him in Prayer, and by Prayer they open the door of their heart to him, but then diſtractions preſs and croud in upon them; yet they can ſay in truth, Lord, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opened my door for theſe, but do deſire that theſe, and al theſe may be put out again; What then, do you not think that God wil be ſatisfied with this anſwer of uprightneſs? Surely he will, and therefore, though theſe diſtractions do croud in upon you, here is matter of affliction, but not of Diſcouragement.</p>

Thus it is between God and a poor ſoul, God loves his Children dearly,<note place="margin">

Yea, the longer you ſtay, the more you ſhal be humbled; and your ſelf-deſpiſing thoughts, becauſe you cannot pray, may pleaſe God more than your beſt prayer: You ſee that when a man angles, he throws his line into the Water, and there is the hook, and the bait, thoſe are heavy; then there is the Cork, and that is light; and when the Fiſher, or the Angler, ſees that the light cork is drawn under water, now the Fiſh bites, ſaith he, now there is hope, now there is ſomthing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: So, you go to prayer, and there is ſomwhat heavy, and weighty in your ſpirit; but there is ſomthing that is of a corky, and light Nature in your ſpirit; the longer you ſtay, the more your Cork ſhall be drawn under water, that lightneſs of Spirit ſhal be drawn under water, and ſo the more you ſhall be humble, and humbled. Thereby you are caught to fan your prayers: There is much Chaff amongſt the good Wheat of our Duties, and Gods delaying time, is our fanning time: when the Fiſh doth not bite, the Fiſher mends his bait; it may be, ſaith he, my hook is not well baited: So ſhould you do, when you take nothing by prayer, Gods delay cals for your amending.</p>

Now is is not an hard thing, and very difficult, for a man to pray, and continue praying, when his heart is hardned, and his ſpirit ſtreightned? eſpecially, if he be ſenſible thereof? then he is ready to deſpond, and ſay, I can pray no more: and is it not a very hard thing, for a man to pray, and perſevere in prayer, when he thinks that God doth not regard his prayer? then he is apt to ſay, why ſhould I pray any longer, for God regards me not? yet now if you do pray, and perform your duty, your obedience is the more obediential, &amp; the more acceptable: and if you would but think of this rule; <hi>Difficulty doth commend duty,</hi> and the leſs you have to ſweeten your action, the more ſweet it is to God, I ſay, if you would but remember this, it would both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you to duty, and keep you from diſcouragement in it.</p>

                     </label> No, no reaſon yet. It is indeed, a great evil, and a ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, to want the Aſſurance of Gods love, and of ones own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: yet notwithſtanding, the want of this Aſſurance, is no ſufficient ground or bottom for your diſcouragement. I confeſs, it is a great evil and a ſore affliction, for a man to want Aſſurance: for ſin and affliction are twiſted together in the want of Aſſurance. As of al bleſſings, thoſe are the greateſt, where Grace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort are joyned together, ſo where ſin and affliction are twiſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, of al afflictions they are the moſt afflictive, and thus it is in the want of Aſſurance: for as in Aſſurance, there is ſomthing of Grace, and ſomthing of comfort or reward, ſo in the want of Aſſurance, there is ſomwhat of ſin or unbelief, and ſomwhat of affliction too, ſin and affliction, affliction and ſin are both twiſted together in the want of Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, a man that wants the Aſſurance of Gods love, and of his intereſt in Chriſt, is neither fit to receive mercy from God, nor to make return of love, and praiſe to God as he ſhould: Not fit to receive mercy as he ſhould, for though he would have Chriſt come in, yet by unbelief he ſhuts the door againſt him; and he makes an evil interpretation of mercies offered unto him; if a mercy or bleſſing be tendered unto him, he ſaith, this comes in judgment to me, it is a bleſſing, indeed, in it ſelf, but I fear it is a judgment to me: Thus he makes an il interpretation of bleſſings and ſo unfit to receive. And he is not fit to make returns of love to God again. Aſſurance returns praiſe. And therefore ſaith the text here, O! my ſoul, wait on God, hope in God, <hi>for I ſhal yet praiſe him,</hi> why? <hi>for he is my God,</hi> praiſe grows upon aſſurance: and upon this account, I ſay, he is neither fit to receive mercy, nor to make return of praiſe as he ſhould.</p>
                  <p>Yea further, He that wants Aſſurance of Gods love, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth too much with Satan; as he that hath the Aſſurance of Gods love, doth converſe with Chriſt, <hi>the ſpirit bearing witneſs to him, that he is the Child of God:</hi> So he that doth want Aſſurance, converſeth with Satan, and Sacan, (though falſly) is ſtil bearing witneſs to his ſpirit, that he is not the child of God. and is it not a miſery to be in theſe converſes with Satan? to be under his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh droppings? <hi>David,</hi> felt one pang of unbelief, and he cryed out and ſaid, <hi>It is too painful for me,</hi> O! what a pain is it then, to lie bed-rid of an unbeleeving heart? you know, a chaſt and a loving wife, counts it an affliction to her, to be followed with the ſolicitations of an unworthy perſon, to ſuſpect, and be jealous of her husbands love; for ſaith ſhe, he doth therefore follow me with theſe ſolicitations, makeing me to ſuſpect my husbands love,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102264:138"/> that ſo he may attain his own filthy deſires. So ſaith a gracious ſoul, the Devil is alwaies following and tempting me, to ſuſpect the Love of Chriſt; and he doth therefore do it, that he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his mind upon me; for the Devil knows wel enough, that the more I ſuſpect Chriſts Love, the more I ſhal embrace Satans love. The truth is (Beloved) this want of Aſſurance of Gods Love, or Intereſt in Chriſt, is an in-let to many ſins and miſeries; for firſt a man doubts of his own Salvation, and after he hath continued doubting, then he riſeth up unto a full concluſion, ſaying, now know I that Chriſt doth not love me, I did but doubt before, but now I know he doth not love me. And after he is riſen to this concluſion, then ſhortly he riſeth higher, and he goes further thus: If Chriſt doth not love me now, he will never love me, and if I have not intereſt in Chriſt now, after all the Preaching I have heard, and Ordinances enjoyed, if I have not an Intereſt in Chriſt now, I ſhal never have it; and ſo the longer I live, the more I aggravate my condemnation, therefore as good in Hel at firſt, as at the laſt; and therefore now, I wil even make a way my ſelf. O! what a black Chain is here? and the firſt link, is the want of Aſſurance. If you ſhould ſee a Child, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> pretty Child, lie in the open ſtreets, and none own it, would it not make your Bowels yern within you? Come to the little one, and ſay, Child, where's thy Father? I know not ſaith the Child: Where's thy Mother, Child? I know not. Who is thy Father? what's thy Fathers name, Child? I know not: Would it not make your heart ake to ſee ſuch a little one in the ſtreets? But for a poor ſoul to lie in the ſtreet, as it were, and not know his Father, whether God be his Father, or the Devil be his Father; for a ſoul to ſay, I do not know my Father, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God in Chriſt, be my Father, yea or no; this is pitiful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. The word, <hi>Father,</hi> is a ſweet word, for it ſweetens all our Duties; take the word Father, out of Prayer, and how ſour is it? Surely therefore it is a ſad, and ſore affliction, to want the Aſſurance of Gods Love in Chriſt. But now, although it be a great evil, and a ſore Affliction for to want this Aſſurance, yet I ſay, the Saints and People of God, have no reaſon to be caſt down, or diſcouraged, although they do want the ſame.</p>

Now, though there may be much unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief bound up in the want of Aſſurance, yet I ſay, the bare want of Aſſurance, is not that unbelief that ſhall damn ones ſoul to all Eternity, not that unbelief which Chriſt threatens with damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if you look into <hi>John,</hi> 3.18. you ſhall find our Savior ſpeaking thus: <hi>He that beleeveth on him, is not condemned: but
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102264:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> he that beleeveth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> But now, leſt any poor ſoul, that would fain beleeve, and cannot, ſhould be afflicted, and troubled at theſe words; therefore ſaith our Savior Chriſt, in the following words, I wil tel you wherein lies the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of Unbelief; verſe 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation</hi> (he ſpeaks in relation to the words before) <hi>And this is the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, That Light is come into the World, and men love Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than Light, becauſe their deeds are evil. For every one that doth evil, hateth the light; neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved, or diſcovered:</hi> This Light is Chriſt. Now therefore, Doeſt thou hate the Light, Chriſt? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keepeſt from it, leſt thy deeds ſhould be diſcovered? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary, Doeſt thou not know there are evil deeds in thy life, and much evil in thy heart? and doeſt thou not therefore deſire to come to Chriſt, who is the true Light, that thy deeds may be diſcovered, and thy ſin amended? Then, though thou canſt not beleeve as thou wouldeſt, and though thou doeſt want Aſſurance, and though thou haſt much Unbelief in thee, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſpoken it, Thou ſhalt never be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ndemned to all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity for this want, but the Lord Chriſt will pardon this unto thee: and therefore certainly, upon this account, Gods People have no reaſon for their diſcouragement.</p>

                     </note>As for their own good: Thereby they do gain experience; thereby they come to ſee the emptineſs, and nothingneſs, of all their own righteouſneſs. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, (ye know the Scripture) Pſal. 116. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, all men are Lyers.</hi> The words in the Hebrew, may be read, I ſaid in my <hi>ſhaking;</hi> I ſaid in my ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, all men are Lyers. <hi>David</hi> was ſhaken by men, and then he ſaw that men were Lyers. So, when a man is ſhaken in his own righteouſneſs, then he ſees the emptineſs, and the lying diſpoſition of it; and, I pray, when is a mans own righteouſneſs more ſhaken, than when he doth want aſſurance of Gods Love? Thereby alſo, a man comes to get more, and ſtronger aſſurance of Gods Love; <hi>Certiſſimum eſt, quod certum eſt poſt incertitudinem;</hi> That is moſt certain, that is certain after uncertainty: The ſhaken Tree grows the ſtrongeſt. It is obſerved of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that of all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, he cryed out, and ſaid, My Lord, and My God. Two <hi>My's,</hi> not one My; My Lord, or My God: but two My's, My Lord, and My God. Two My's, Why? Becauſe he had had two No's before, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs I may put my finger into his ſide, I will not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102264:139"/> beleeve.</hi> So you read it; but in the Original, there are two No's, <hi>I will not, not beleeve;</hi> a double Not. And as there was two No's of Unbelief, ſo there is two My's of Faith. So far as a good man is ſunk in Unbelief, ſo far he wil riſe in Faith; ſo much as a man is ſhaken by Unbelief, and in the want of Aſſurance, ſo much he will riſe unto Aſſurance, and be confirmed, and ſetled in it.</p>
                  <p>And as for Others: A man is never more fit to comfort, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to ſatisfie others in their fears, than when he hath been in fears, and doubting himſelf. It is a good Speech that <hi>Maldonet</hi> hath out of <hi>Bernard; Citius quidem ego qui infirmus ſum;</hi> I would rather beleeve doubting <hi>Thomas,</hi> than confident <hi>Peter:</hi> I would rather beleeve poor doubting <hi>Thomas,</hi> than <hi>Peter</hi> that never doubted. <hi>Thomas</hi> having once doubted, knew how to deal with a poor doubting ſoul. Thus, I ſay, God doth order the want of the Aſſurance of his Servants, unto their Own, and Others good: and therefore no reaſon, that they ſhould be caſt down, and quite diſcouraged, although they do want Aſſurance for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: If a man, a gracious man, may have comfort; yea, and live comfortably, although he do want Aſſurance, then he hath no reaſon to be quite diſcouraged, in caſe he want it. Now, though it may ſeem a Paradox to you, yet you ſhall find a Truth in it; I ſay, a man thae hath no Aſſurance for the preſent, may have Comfort; yea, he may live comfortably, if things be rightly ordered.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:102264:140"/> and Vertues of men. Now (my Beloved) is there no excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in God himſelf to content the ſoul? Is there no Faithfulneſs in God? Is there no Love and Mercy in God himſelf? Is not the Lord, the God of all Conſolation, and God of Mercy, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to my Condition? Is there not an Ocean of Excellent Love and Grace in God himſelf? How many ſweet Stories of Love and Grace, may you read in this little Book of the Bible? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a man that hath no Aſſurance, now and then may have ſome Promiſe thrown into his Soul, to uphold him with. When <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> was by the Brook, and could not enjoy the ordinary meat of the Land, a Raven brought him meat: And when ever was any godly man in ſuch a condition, but he had one Raven or other to bring him Comfort? Somtimes a Temptation is a Raven, God makes it ſo; ſomtimes a Deſertion is a Raven; ſomtimes Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſomtimes a Particular Word and Promiſe is thrown into his ſoul; and is there no comfort there? I ſay, though a man do want Aſſurance for the preſent, he may live comfortably. Surely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a Godly man hath no reaſon for his diſcouragement, although for the preſent he doth want Aſſurance.</p>

Now ſo it is, that the condition of one, is the thing promiſed in another Promiſe. For Example: In one Promiſe, Repentance is the Condition of the Promiſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.37, 38. <hi>Joel,</hi> 2.15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

I <hi>will put my Spirit into you, and cauſe ye to walk in my waies.</hi> In one Promiſe, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is the Condition; <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. <hi>He that continueth to the end, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> But in another Promiſe, it is the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>His Leaf ſhall not wither:</hi> Ezek. 36. I <hi>will put my fear into your hearts, and ye ſhall not depart from me.</hi> In one Scripture of the old Teſtament, the coming of the deliverer is promiſed to the Jews, upon condition that they turn from ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 59.20. <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come out of</hi> Zion, <hi>and unto them that turn from ungodlineſs in</hi> Jacob.

In the beginning, the Lord made a Covenant with man, a Covenant of Works; <hi>Do this, and live:</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt man, ſtood as a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102264:141"/> common perſon for us all, to perform the Condition of <hi>Doing:</hi> and if <hi>Adam</hi> had performed the Condition, we all had performed the condition. Now, the Lord makes a new Covenant of Grace with man, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is a Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and he ſtands as a Common Perſon, and if he perform the Condition, then all his Seed do perform the Condition. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath performed the Condition for all his Seed: although the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did not perform the Condition for his Seed, yet the Second <hi>Adam</hi> hath performed the Condition of the Promiſe, and of the Covenant, for his Seed to the full. Now if all theſe Three things be true, namely, That a man may go to the Promiſe, the Conditional Promiſe with acceptance, although he hath not performed the Condition; That the Condition of one Promiſe, is the thing promiſed, in another Promiſe; That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hath performed the Condition of the Promiſe for you, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you can perform it: Have ye then, any reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and to keep off from the Promiſe, becauſe you have not performed the Condition? But ſo it is, That a Child of God may go to a Conditional Promiſe with acceptance, although he hath not performed the Condition; And the Condition of one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is the thing promiſed in another; And the Lord Jeſus, our Second <hi>Adam,</hi> hath performed the Condition of all the Promiſes, for all his Seed: Surely therefore, you have no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in this reſpect.</p>

But ſo it was with <hi>Joſhua</hi> here, he had loſt the ſight of the Promiſe which once he had. And as for the Threatening; you know how it was with <hi>David:</hi> having ſinned greatly in the matter of <hi>

Now, a Threatening is therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it may not be fulfilled. <hi>Joſhuah</hi> knew this ſo well, that he profeſſeth to the Lord, That therefore he fled to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith he, <hi>O Lord, I knew that thou art a merciful God.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, I knew, O Lord, thou art ſo merciful a God, that though thou haſt threatened <hi>Nineveh,</hi> yet thou wilt reverſe thy Threatening. But a Promiſe once given unto a ſoul, ſhal never be reverſed or repealed.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102264:142"/> of men; though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, no man diſanulleth, or addeth thereunto. Now to</hi> Abraham, <hi>and his Seed, were the Promiſes made.</hi> And therefore (ſaith the Apoſtle) the Promiſe ſhall not be diſanulled, although the Law came after the Promiſe. But if the Promiſe that the Lord gave to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not diſanulled by the Law, that came four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years after; verſe 17. <hi>Wherefore then ſerves the Law?</hi> Verſe 19, he tels you, <hi>It was added becauſe of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> So now ſay you, If that the Promiſe that God hath given heretofore, be not diſanulled, and made void, by the Threatening that follows after, wherefore then was the Law, or the Threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given unto my ſoul? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion: God had ſome tranſgreſſion of yours to diſcover unto you, that you did not think of, and therefore the Threatening, and the Law came after. But the Promiſe is quite out of ſight, and I have loſt it. And did not the Jews alſo loſe the ſight of the Promiſe which was given to <hi>Abraham?</hi> When the Lord gave the Law, and they ſtood quaking and trembling before Mount Sinai, did not they then loſe the ſight of the Promiſe that was given to <hi>Abraham?</hi> So ſay I, although thou haſt loſt the ſight of the Promiſe that once thou hadſt, and a threatening be come in the room of it, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that was once given thee (it may be four hundred and thirty daies ago, or many years ago) ſhal never be diſanulled, or rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: And the reaſon is this; Becauſe God doth not repent in the matter of the Goſpel. Ye read in Scripture, that God is ſaid ſomtimes to repent, <hi>It repented the Lord that he made man;</hi> ſomtimes it is ſaid, that the Lord doth not repent, I <hi>am not a man that</hi> I <hi>ſhould repent:</hi> How are theſe two reconciled, God doth repent, and God doth not repent? Thus to our preſent Purpoſe: God repents as to the matter of the Threatening, but God never repents as to the matter of the Promiſe: God repents as to the matter of the Threatening, and therefore ſaith the Lord to <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> I <hi>am weary of my repenting;</hi> I have threatened, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and I am weary of threatening. Here God repented as to the matter of the threatening; but God never repents as to the matter of the Promiſe. And therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>The Gifts and Calling of God, are without Repentance.</hi> And the Promiſe is a great Gift. So then, as to the matter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, God doth never repent. Wherefore, poor ſoul, haſt thou a Promiſe given thee, may be five years ago, may be ten years ago, may be twenty years ago, and haſt thou loſt the ſight of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? and inſtead of the Promiſe, is there a Threatening come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſoul, that makes thy heart quake and tremble? I here tell thee from the Lord, the Promiſe that was once given unto thee, though now thou haſt loſt the ſight of it, ſhall never be repealed, or

We read, indeed, of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> notorious for his deſpair; when his friends came to comfort him, having ſpake comfortable words unto him, That he ſaid why go ye about to comfort me? comfort belongs not to me, for I am a reprobate. O! ſaid one of his friends, do not ſay ſo, for none are able to ſay ſo, yes, ſaid he, as the elect of God, have a ſpirit within them, bearing witneſs, that they are the children of God; ſo reprobates have another ſpirit, bearing witneſs with their ſpirits, that they are not the children of God, but the children of Satan; and ſuch a ſpirit of reprobation have I. But my beloved, if there be ſuch a ſpirit, or a teſtimony of reprobation as this is, either it muſt be, from the ſpirit of God, or from the ſpirit of Satan: if from the ſpirit of Satan, then he is a lyer, not to be beleeved; if it be from the ſpirit of God, how doth it ſuit with the word? for the ſpirit of God, is called the Comforter; can ſuch a ſpirit of reprobation come from the comforter? and if you have ſuch a teſtimony as this is, either you muſt have it from the word, or from the ſpirit of God alone, without the word; if from the word, then from the threatening: for it is not from the promiſe, nor from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: if from the threatening, a threatening may be repealed, a threatening, may be reverſed, as you have heard, and if you have it from the ſpirit of the Lord, how can it be, that the ſpirit ſhould be called a Comforter? ſurely therefore, if you have ſuch a ſpirit of reprobation in your boſom, it is from Satan, and he is a Lyer. But (my beloved) I wil in this appeal to you, whether do you not think, that there is many a ſoul now in heaven, that whilſt he

Yea daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tels us, beſides the Parable of the fooliſh Virgins, That he may die in theſe perſwaſions. So, on the contrary, a man may think his condition naught, and go fearing and trembling a long while, yea, even die under theſe fears, yet his condition may be very good. (Conſider it rightly) I know indeed, ordinarily, God doth come in with ſome comfort or other unto a child of God before he dies; but I would be loath to ſay, and you wil be loath to think, that certainly, that man goes to hel, that doubteth of his Salvation, or that dies doubting of his Salvation. No, poſſibly a man may doubt, and fear, and doubt long, even die doubting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſetled aſſurance of Gods love; yet he may go to Heaven, and be ſaved for ever.

                     <hi>but ſuppoſe I do want it for the preſent, what ſhall I now do, that I may bear up againſt Diſcouragements in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some few things by way of Direction here, and ſo I conclude this Argument.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, Doeſt thou want Aſſurance of Gods Love, and of thine own Salvation? Labor more and more, for to put to Sea, I mean, to the Sea and Ocean of Gods Love, and the deeps of Chriſts Merit and Satisfaction. When you are at Sea in a Storm, or ſtreſs of Weather, you deſire Sea-room, and if ye have Sea-room enough, ye think all is well: It may be, there are ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in the Veſſel, or Ship, and they ſay, For the Love of God ſet us aſhore, we are not able to ride out this ſtorm; O! ſet us upon ſome Land or other: But the skilful Marriner ſaith, Nay, but ſtill keep to Sea, if ye come to the Shoar we are undone, we are all loſt Creatures. So in this caſe; the time of the want of your Aſſurance, is a ſtorm-time, it is a time of great ſtreſs upon your ſoul; and if ye skil not the Methods of Chriſt, you wil ſay, O! now ſet me upon ſome Duty, upon the Coaſt of mine own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or mine own Holineſs: but if you have a skil in the way of the Goſpel, you will rather cry out, and ſay, O! Lord, keep my ſoul in the Ocean of thy free Love, Sea-room, Sea-room, and all is wel enough. Now there is Sea-room enough in the Ocean of Gods free Love, and of Chriſts Merits, and Satisfaction; but if you touch upon your own Righteouſneſs, you do but endanger your ſoul, and ſink your own heart into more deſpairing doubts and fears; ſtand off therefore now from your own Shoar, and keep to Sea, even that great Sea of Gods Love, and Chriſts Merits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: If you do want Aſſurance, Take heed that you do not hearken unto any thing out of an Ordinance, contrary unto the comfort which the Lord ſpeaks to you in the time of an Ordinance. Ye come to an Ordinance, and there the Lord begins to comfort you, ſo you go away, and ye are ſatisfied, and your ſouls are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed; but then afterwards, you ſit down, and parly with Satan,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102264:146"/> and with your own ſouls; and ye loſe all again, and doubt again, turning Gods Wine into your own Vinegar, and are unſatisfied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But ſuppoſe that a Father ſhould give an Eſtate of Land unto his Child, and make it over to him with the beſt Conveyance that the Law can provide; and then this Son having laid down his Conveyance ſome where negligently, a cunning Lawyer (that he may get Money from him) ſhould come and write on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of this Conveyance, For ſuch and ſuch Reaſons, this Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is naught: Should the Son do well thereupon to ſay, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath done nothing for me, I have been deceived all this while, my Father hath given me nothing? Were this fair dealing with his Father? and if he ſhould run this courſe, ſhould he ever have any Aſſurance of his Land firm in his own thoughts? Now, ſo it is with you that are the People of God; the Lord hath given you a fair Inheritance; Heaven is your Inheritance, the faireſt and beſt Inheritance; the Lord hath given it you under Hand and Seal, and ſomtimes you think your Evidence is cleer, and you lay it by, and Satan comes, and ſcribbles on the back of it, and he ſaith, it is naught; and you beleeve it, and then you doubt again, and you are unſatisfied again: Is this fair dealing with God? Surely no. Wherefore then, doeſt thou want Aſſurance? The way to get it, and the way not to be diſcouraged in the want of it, is this: Take heed that ye never hearken to any thing, out of an Ordinance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Comfort which you have received in an Ordinance.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> Thirdly: Take heed that you be not diſcontented with your Condition; Diſcontentment, breeds Diſcouragement: But doeſt thou want the Aſſurance of Gods Love? Say thus with thine own ſoul; However it be, yet wil I wait on God, when the Lord plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he will give me Aſſurance; I will only labor to be contented with my condition. But if ye be diſcontented, ye wil certainly be diſcouraged.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> Fourthly: If you do want Aſſurance of Gods Love, and of your own Salvation, Take heed that you do not ſay, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be Aſſured; take heed you do not ſay, I ſhal never have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; take heed you do not ſay, I ſhall never be Comforted; take heed you do not ſay, I ſhal never have the Teſtimony of the Spirit, bearing witneſs with my Spirit, that I am the Child of God; do not ſay thus, I ſhal never be helped, I am in a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I ſhal never be better; I am in an uncomfortable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I ſhal never be comforted; I want Aſſurance, and I ſhall never have Aſſurance. Beloved! this ye cannot ſay, for who knows what God will do, whoſe waies are in the deep, and whoſe foot-ſteps are not known? You know how it is with a ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; If the Phyſitian come, and tels him, there is hope of life, then
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102264:147"/> his heart dies not; but if the Phyſitian ſaith to him, Sir, you are in a great and dangerous Feaver, and I would wiſh you to ſettle your Eſtate, and look out for comfort for your ſoul, for the truth is, you will never be recovered; then his heart dies. So here, take a poor ſoul that wants Aſſurance, If he ſaith, there is hope that I may be aſſured, he is not diſcouraged: but if he ſaith, I have no Aſſurance, and I ſhall never have it, then he is quite diſcouraged; it is this word, <hi>Never,</hi> that doth diſcourage: O! I ſhal never be encouraged, and I ſhall never have Aſſurance, and I ſhall never have the Teſtimony of Gods Spirit. Take heed that you do not ſay, I ſhall never be Aſſured, that is a Temptation; take heed of the word <hi>Never,</hi> in this caſe.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>5</label> Fiftly, and laſtly: Carry this for a Rule with you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it much; That the leſs Aſſurance you have, the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious your obedience may be, and the more kindly God may take it at your hands. It is no great matter for a man to write, and to work by the Day light, or Candle light; but for a man to write, or to work in the dark, is hard. So here, it is no great matter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively, for a man to pray, and to work ſpiritually, while he is in the light; but for a poor ſoul to pray, and to work towards God, and to be obedient, when he is in the dark, and hath no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Love of God, is ſomthing: I confeſs indeed, that the more Aſſurance you have, the more full your Obedience will be; but the leſs Aſſurance you have, the more ingenuous may be your Obedience; I ſay, The more full your Aſſurance is, the more full and large your Obedience will be; but the leſs Aſſurance you have, the more ingenuous your Obedience may be. Every Child will ſerve his Father for his Portion, and for his Inheritance; but when a Child ſhall doubt of his Fathers Love, yea, when a Child, ſhall conclude and ſay, I know that my Father will diſ-inherit me, I know that my Father will beſtow nothing upon me, yet I will ſerve him, becauſe he is my Father; will not all men ſay, Here is ingenuity indeed in this Child? So between God and you; It is good for a Chriſtian to be obedient at all times, and the more Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance you have, the more you are bound to obey; but doth thy ſoul fear, that God will diſ-inherit thee? and yet doeſt thou ſay, However it be, I will obey God, for he is my Father? though I cannot ſee him, yet wil I ſerve him; and though I have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from God, yet will I be obedient to him, for it is my Duty, he is my Father? The Lord will take this kindly at thine hands, and what thou wanteſt in the largeneſs, ſhal be made up in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity of thine Obedience. Wherefore then, doeſt thou want Aſſurance of the Love of God? Comfort thy ſelf with this, and ſay within thine own ſoul, well, though I do want Aſſurance, I
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102264:147"/> hope, through Grace, I am in ſome meaſure Obedient, and the leſs Aſſurance I ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, the more kindly God takes my Obedience at my hand: and therefore, why ſhould I be diſcouraged, or caſt down? Think, and think often of this Rule; and it will help you to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and bear up your hearts alſo in the want of Aſſurance.</p>

                     </label> No; No reaſon yet: I grant, That the leaſt Temptations are great Afflictions; for the more a man is unfitted by Affliction for Gods Service, either in doing good, or receiving good, the worſer,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102264:148"/> and more heavy is that Affliction to a gracious Spirit. Now, though God doth ſo over-rule the Temptations of his People, that they receive good thereby, (as appeareth afterward) yet the Temptation in it ſelf, doth indiſpoſe a man unto what is good. The more a man is tempted unto what is evil, the more a man is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from what is good: It is an Affliction to a gracious heart, to be conflicting, fighting, and combating with a man; but in Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we do combate and conflict immediately with Satan, who is the Prince of the Air; with Principalities, and Powers; with that evil One, who for his devouring Nature, is called, a Lyon; for his Cruelty, is called, a Dragon; and for his ſubtilty, an old Serpent: and in every Temptation, a poor ſoul goes into the field with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and fights a Duel with him. Satan hath (ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) deſired you; in which Duel, and Combat, a man doth not miſcarry for this preſent Life barely; but if he miſcarry, he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carries to all Eternity, he dies, is killed, and ſlain to all Eternity: O! what a mighty hazard doth a poor ſoul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>un in every Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The Chaſt, and good Woman, counts it an Affliction to her, ſo long as ſhe lives, if ſhe be but once violenced; if a filthy perſon meet her in the field, and violence her, though ſhe do not conſent unto him; ſhe wrings her hands, and ſaith, I am undone for ever. Now, theſe Temptations, are the Solicitations of an unclean Spirit, and what though a man do not conſent unto them, yet thereby his ſoul ſuffers violence; O! ſaith a gracious ſoul, what though I do not conſent, yet what an infinite miſery is it to be thus abuſed, defiled, and violenced by theſe Temptations! The more any affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth ſeize on ſoul and body, the greater it is: it is Comfort in a Family, that the Wife is well, when the Husband is ſick; or that the Husband is well, when the Wife is down: where both are down at once, it is a ſad Family indeed. So, though the Soul be afflicted, yet if the Body be well, although the Body be afflicted, yet if the Spirit be well, it is ſome comfort; but where both are down, the Condition is ſad: and ſeldom doth any great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion befall a man, but Soul and Body are both down at once; though at firſt it falls upon the Spirit, yet it deſcends into, and fires the Body. And therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, I received a Meſſenger of Satan, a thorn in my fleſh, buffeting of me:</hi> As in the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, though the Comforts be powred out upon the Soul and Spirit, yet they run down upon the Body: So, in the troubles of Temptation, though they ſeize firſt upon the inward man, yet they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God had put <hi>Job</hi> into Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans hand, only with this reſerve, <hi>See that thou spare his life.</hi> The Devil having the power; firſt he loads him with outward Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and then with inward Temptations; while he was under his

Bleſſing the Lord, ſaying, <hi>The Lord gives, and the Lord takes away, bleſſed be his Name;</hi> but when the Volly of Temptations came, then ſee what a ſad Condition the good man was in, how he was all on fire, as if <hi>Job</hi> could not be found in <hi>Job:</hi> while he was under theſe Afflictions, he rebuked his Wife, for ſaying, <hi>Curſe God, and die;</hi> but now being under Temptations himſelf, he wiſheth to die, and curſeth the day of his Birth: In <hi>Job,</hi> 7.15. <hi>My Soul chuſeth ſtrangling, and death, rather than my life:</hi> but had this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any influence upon his Body too? It ſeems his heart, and ſoul, and ſpirit, was much diſquieted; for he ſaith, <hi>Why haſt thou ſet me as a mark againſt thee?</hi> ver. 20. But was his Body fired with it too? yes, verſe 13, 14. <hi>When I ſaid, my Bed ſhall comſort me, my Couch ſhall eaſe my complaint; then thou skareſt me with Dreams, and terrifieſt me with viſions:</hi> As now we find by Experience, many poor ſouls cannot ſleep while they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Temptations; and if you will ſee the Sum and up-ſhot of all, read what he ſaies at verſe 20. <hi>I am a burden to my ſelf:</hi> and ſo many now, Why ſhould I live any longer? I am a burden to my Family, I am a burden to mine Acquaintance, a burden to all my Friends, I am a burden to my ſelf; who knows the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a poor tempted ſoul, but he that bears it? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. Temptations are ranked among the greateſt Afflictions; <hi>They were ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, were tempted:</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. it is ſaid of our Savior, That <hi>himſelf ſuffered being tempted,</hi> yet he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not under his Temptation.

And in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.12. it is ſaid, <hi>Wo to the Inhabitants of the Earth, and of the Sea, for the Devil is come down unto you, having great wrath.</hi> And wherein is his wrath more ſeen, than in his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? O! what a ſad, and woful condition is it then, to lie under Temptations! Yet, let me tel you, though there be ſome ſuffering in every Temptation, and the leaſt temptation is a great Affliction, yet the Saints and People of God, have no reaſon to be diſcouraged or caſt down, whatever their Temptations be.</p>

Now, Satan doth tempt that he may tempt; he tempts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one ſin, that he may tempt unto another; he tempteth a man to

Now ſo it is, Chriſt was a common Perſon, not only in his death, but in his life; he did act, and work, and bear as a common perſon, as our Second <hi>Adam</hi> all along; <hi>Chriſtus non meruit ſibi;</hi> Chriſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102264:150"/> did not die for himſelf, nor obey for himſelf; but he did die for us, and obey for us, and all his Seed were in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in a common perſon; look whatever evils Chriſt did bear, thoſe he did bear for us, and we did bear in him, as in our Second <hi>Adam;</hi> and therefore, when he was tempted, he ſtood as a common perſon in his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and in him all the Saints and People of God, who are his Seed, were tempted, and in his overcoming, they did overcome; for as when the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted, he being a Common Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we al were tempted in him; and when he yielded to Satan, we did all yield in him; when he was overcome, we were overcome in him; and when he did eat the forbidden fruit, all his Seed did eat in him; and every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> may now ſay, I did then eat the forbidden Fruit: So when Chriſt was tempted, all his Seed were tempted in him; and when he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, all his Seed overcame in him. And therefore when you read the Story of Chriſts Temptations, ye are not barely to ſay, thus, and thus, Chriſt reſiſted for my Example; but in his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, I did reſiſt; in his overcoming, I did overcome: for, as I did eat in the Firſt <hi>Adams</hi> eating, and yield in the Firſt <hi>Adams</hi> yielding; ſo I did refuſe, and reſiſt, and overcome in Chriſt, the Second <hi>Adams</hi> refuſing, reſiſting, and overcoming: Thus with all the Saints, and People of God, who are the Seed of the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> Chriſt hath not only overcome their Temptations for them, but in Chriſt their ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>4</label> Fourthly: If God hath ſuch an over-ruling hand of Grace, upon all the Temptations of the Saints, as that they ſhall turn to their good; then they have no reaſon to be caſt down, or to be diſcouraged, becauſe of them. Now, God would never ſuffer his People to be tempted, but that he intendeth to deſtroy their Temptations, by their Temptations; look what is the end, and iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, of an evil, that was Gods deſign in ſuffering that evil to come to paſs: and this is the end, and iſſue of all the Saints Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thereby they are more enlightened: <hi>Tentatio dat intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectum;</hi> Temptation gives underſtanding; tempting times, are teaching times.</p>
                  <p>Thereby they are more humbled; <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) I received a Meſſenger of Satan</hi> (he ſpeaks it twice) <hi>that I might not be exalted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thereby they are the more occaſioned to live in God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him. <hi>Watch and pray</hi> (ſaith our Savior) <hi>leſt ye fall into Temptation:</hi> Watching doth note our diligence; Praying doth note our dependance: And why Watch, and Pray? but, leſt ye enter into Temptation.</p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:102264:150"/>
                  <p>Thereby the Grace, and Power, and Might of God in Chriſt, is the more diſcovered, and revealed to them; <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Paul,</hi> in the time of his Temptation; a word which he had not heard before.</p>
                  <p>Thereby their Graces are more encreaſed, as the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites were multiplied by being oppreſſed. <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thereby all the Saints are made to triumph over Satan: It is a Chriſtians Duty, not only to triumph over the World, but over Satan; therefore, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The God of Peace tread down Satan under your Feet;</hi> thoſe are words of triumph: and <hi>Paul</hi> in the name of other Chriſtians, triumphs over Principalities and Powers; How ſhal a man triumph, if he never have Victory? and how ſhall he have the Victory, if he never fights?

Give me leave to propound you a Parable: Suppoſe two men, one goes very brave, fares deliciouſly, is very merry, and full of money; yet hath no Lands, no Calling, nothing left him, no friends to maintain him, nor no honeſt way known to bring him in money, and yet he is full of it: The other works hard, fares meanly, goes plainly, and he is oft complaining, I fear I ſhal want, and miſcarry, yet he hath a Calling, ſome Land, good Friends, and ſome Money: Which of theſe two think you, doth come moſt honeſtly by his Money? Will you not all ſay, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For, though he hath but little, yet he works, hath a Lawful Calling, waies known for to bring it in. But as for the other, though fine brave, and looks high, yet he hath nothing to bring it in; I ſear he comes not well by it. So Spiritually: there are two ſorts of People in the world, One that is very confident of his Salvation, and full of Comfort, yet he prayeth not in private, reads not, meditates not, examineth not his own heart, takes no pains about his ſoul, but is often ſpending, keeping ill company, will be ſomtimes drunk, ſwear, and be unclean, yet he is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102264:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> he ſhall go to Heaven: The other praies, hears, reads, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates, walketh with all ſtrictneſs in his life, and converſation, yet he is alwaies doubting, and fearing; but through Grace he hath ſome Comfort: Which of theſe two, think you, is in the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and comes moſt honeſtly by his Comfort? Will you not ſay, ſurely, the latter? for though he fears, yet he is alwaies do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, working Heaven-ward: The other, though confident, and ful of Comforts, hath no good way for to bring them in, and therefore ſurely his Evidence for Heaven is ſtolen, his Comforts are all ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: But as for the other, though he hath but little Comfort, yet he comes truly by it. Thus it may be with you; whilſt others ſwaggering it, and braving it out with their Comfort, and falſe Confidence, go to Hell, and periſh everlaſtingly.

Thus doth Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan do; when he cannot drive a gracious ſoul out of the field, any other way, then he preſenteth ſuch horrid, inhumane ſuggeſtions to him, that he may ſcare him from the good waies of God: it is not in our power to hinder Satan from preſenting theſe things to our thoughts. When you come into wicked, ungodly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Company, if they wil ſwear, and curſe, and blaſpheme, you cannot hinder them from ſpeaking, nor your ſelf from hearing; you may ſit down, and mourn, ſaying, O! what Blaſphemy is here! what Curſing is here! but do what you can, they will fill your Ears with theſe things: Now Satan being a Spirit, he is able to preſent theſe Blaſphemies to your Spirits, and you cannot hinder it: you may cry out and ſay, O! what Blaſphemy is here!

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102264:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> thereof, would keep him from that fleſhly luſt,<note place="margin">Difficilius eſt pugnare cum libidine quam cum cruce.</note> counting it more eaſe to combat with pain, than with luſt, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks, and hereby he was preſerved. I do not ſpeak of this fact to commend it, but only to ſhow, that God doth ſomtimes keep his Children from luſt, by pain. Now in theſe blaſphemous ſuggeſtions, you find a great deal of pain, and if you were not in theſe pains, you would be luſting after other evils: God ſeeth what filthy, vile, luſting hearts you have, and therfore ſuffers theſe pains for to come upon you, and ſo you are kept from luſt: Did you never know a man kept from luſt by theſe Temptations? yea, did you never know a man converted to God by occaſion of theſe Temptations? I have, and I think many, many poor ſouls that have lived in an ignorant Condition a long time, then it pleaſed God to ſuffer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to throw in theſe Temptations, theſe horrid Temptations, whereby they were ſo amazed, &amp; ſtartled, that thereupon, they loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into their own condition, were converted unto Jeſus Chriſt. The more delights, &amp; complacencies a man takes in ſin, the more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is the ſin: the more a mans fleſh trembleth, &amp; his ſoul is burdened under Temptation, the leſs ſinful. Now, cannot you ſay in truth, Lord, though theſe be my greateſt burdens, yet they are my leaſt delights? Yes: Well then, be of good Comfort, the Lord doth but hereby keep you from other ſins, and therefore why ſhould you be diſcouraged whatever theſe Temptations be? As for the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; He never ſins againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, that fears he hath ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

When a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man is tempted to what is evil, he rather ſtartles at the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and at the Puniſhment, than at the Evil, and ſin of it. And this we ſee cleerly in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. our Savior tels the Diſciples, at verſe 21. that one of them ſhould betray him; whereupon, they were all of them aſtoniſhed, and ſaid every one, one by one, <hi>Lord, is it</hi> I? Theſe were good Diſciples. <hi>Judas</hi> yet ſtirs not: But at verſe 25. it is ſaid, <hi>Then</hi> Judas <hi>which betrayed him, Anſwered, and ſaid, Maſter, is it</hi> I? Then, When? Look to verſe 24. and you ſhal read, that our Savior ſpeaks of the burden, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of his ſin; <hi>The Son of man goes, as it is written of him; but wo unto that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for that man, if he had not been born. Then</hi> Judas <hi>anſwered, Is it</hi> I, <hi>Lord?</hi> Then he ſtartled. The true, and gracious Diſciples of Chriſt, ſtartled at the ſin, when Chriſt did but name the ſin; but Then, not a word from <hi>Judas:</hi> but when Chriſt ſpeaks of the puniſhment, and burden of his ſin, then <hi>Judas</hi> ſtartleth, and not a word from them: So that plainly, a gracious ſoul ſtartleth at the Evil of a Temptation, more than the Burden of it; a wicked man, more at the burden, than at the Evil of it. This is the way of the Godly, and Ungodly, in their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>And as for you poor, tempted, doubting Souls, that labor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſad Temptations, and think it hath not been with you, as with others; have you not even found it thus? Can you not ſay of a Truth, Lord, My Soul hath found it thus? For after I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I have been tempted again, to doubt of my Child-ſhip, and to ſad deſpair; when I have been tempted to ſin, and have fallen into it, I have laid all upon my ſelf, and ſaid, it is no Temptation, but this is my own corruption; yea Lord, thou knoweſt, my ſoul hath been more ſtartled at the Evil of the Temptation, than at the Burden; as for the Burden of my Temptation, I leave that to thee, take it off when thou wilt; but O that my ſoul were freed from the evil of it: Then be of good Comfort, it is no otherwiſe with you, than what may be with Gods deareſt Children; your ſpot is no other, than what may be the ſpot of Gods own People.</p>
                  <p>And whereas you ſay, I fear that al is not right, becauſe I find ſuch Temptations now, ſince I have looked towards Heaven, which I did never feel before.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And if God do not meaſure a godly man by any one Action, under any preſent Temptation, nor caſt his everlaſting condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; then what reaſon is there, why he ſhould be diſcouraged in this reſpect? Look into the Scripture, and you ſhall find, That though God doth chaſtiſe his People for their miſcarriage, and change of their behavior, under their Temptation; yet he doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meaſure a godly man, or caſt his everlaſting Condition by that. You wil not meaſure Milk when it ſeeths, and wallops, but when it is cool: And God wil not meaſure his Children by what they are, when they wallop in ſome Temptation; but by what they are, when they are cool, and moſt themſelves. So he did deal with <hi>Job, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and al his Children: indeed he doth not deal ſo by the wicked, he meaſures them ſomtimes by one carriage, and they are caſt thereby, that even everlaſtingly they are caſt thereby. <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> lyed but once to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, that we read of, and Satan had a hand therein; for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Why hath Satan filled your heart, that you ſhould lie unto the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> yet they were caſt thereby. It was but one Act that <hi>Saul</hi> did when he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and the Fatlings, yet he was caſt thereby. It was but one act that <hi>Adam</hi> did, and <hi>Eve</hi> did, when they did eat the forbidden Fruit, and Satan temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to it, yet they were caſt thereby, and al Man-kind loſt thereby, Why? Becauſe they were upon a Covenant of Works. So, when men are under a Covenant of Works, if they miſcarry but in one action, though tempted thereto by Satan, yet God may caſt them thereby. Now al the wicked ſtil, are under the Covenant of Works; and therefore though it be but one act wherein they miſcarry, and they be drawn thereunto by Satan, yet God ſomtimes doth, and juſtly may caſt them thereby unto al Eternity. But as for the Saints and People of God, they are not under a Covenant of Works, but of Grace, al of them are ſo; and therefore God deals graciouſly with them, not meaſuring them by any one carriage, under one Temptation; No, ſaith the Lord, it is but the time of their Temptation, I wil not meaſure this man or woman, by what they are now; but as they are, when they are cool, moſt themſelves, and out of Temptation: O! what a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Priviledg is this!

If a man be in debt, and under an Arreſt; ſo long as he thinks he hath friends to bail him, or ſome Goods and Commodities to make ſale of, he is not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; but if he expect much from his friends, and all fail him, and his goods be ſeized, that he cannot have help come in at that door, nor from any other means, which he expected from, then he is quite diſcouraged. If a man be in the Water, wherein there is danger of drowning; ſo long as he can get hold of ſomthing that wil bear him up, he is not diſcouraged; but if he lay hold of ſome tuft of Graſs on the Bank ſide, and that breaks, he falls back again, and is more plunged into the Water; and if he be not ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of al thoughts, he is more diſcouraged than ever. So here, In Temptation, we are as in the Water, and in fear of drowning, crying out, We ſink, we ſink; then we fly to ſome tuft of Graſs, ſome means or other, and if that break, or fail, then we are quite diſcouraged: Would you not therefore be dejected, or caſt down in time of Temptation; take heed that you do not lay all your ſtrength upon one tuft of Graſs; this, or that mans Counſel; this, or that particular means; but ſay rather, I am now indeed in the deep, and in fear of drowning, ſee no means of deliverance; but Gods waies are in the deep, and he is infinite, he hath waies and means that I know not of; therefore though I uſe the means, yet I will not reſt on them, and though all tufts of Graſs break, and

Doth he not therefore hide his face for a moment, that he may not turn his back upon them for ever? Doth he not therefore forſake them for a moment, that they might die unto all the world, and long after Heaven, where there is no forſaking? Doth he not therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them for a moment, that they might die unto the way of ſence, and learn to live by Faith, which is the proper work of this Life? Doth he not therefore forſake them for a moment, that in this Winter of their Deſertion, the Weeds, and Vermin of their ſins, may be killed, and mortified? Doth he not therefore forſake them for a moment, that he may ſee their Love to him? In time of his Preſence, we have the ſence of his Love to us; but in the time of his abſence, then he ſeeth, and we our ſelves have the ſence of our Love to him. Doth he not therefore forſake them for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that their very Joyes, and Comforts may be more fervent, exalted, and enlarged? It is our Nature to rejoyce moſt in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, when it is redeemed from the hand of Death, and recovered from loſs: The wiſe men, when they ſaw the loſt Star again, then

The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man in the Goſpel, is the evil man; and this evil Spirit ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on <hi>Saul</hi> as ſoon as God did forſake him; for an envious, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, perſecuting Spirit came upon him againſt <hi>David,</hi> and the Saints with him. So when God forſakes a man finally, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Spirit enters him. When God forſakes his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Satan, that evil Spirit comes to them; for when God goes, Satan comes: but there is much difference between a tempting Satan, and a perſecuting Satan: tempting Satan comes to the Saints, when they are deſerted; but a perſecuting Satan doth not enter into them.

But though a man ride a great Journey, yet he may come again; and ye ſay, ſurely he wil come again; why? Becauſe ſtill his Goods, Wife, and Children are in his Houſe. So if Chriſt reject a man, and go away finally, he carries away all his Goods, Spiritual Gifts, Graces, and Principles: But though he be long abſent, yet if his Houſhold-ſtuff abide in the heart; if there be the ſame deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, and delight in him, and admiring of him, and mourning for want of him; ye may ſay, ſurely he wil come again; Why?

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly: Did ye ever know a man finally forſaken of Chriſt, who did long after the preſence of Chriſt, as the greateſt good? and looked upon his abſence as the greateſt evil, and affliction in all the world? being willing to kiſs the feet of Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſerve him in the loweſt, and meaneſt condition, ſo he might but enjoy him? We find, that the Saints deſire, above all things, to be kiſt with the kiſſes of Chriſts mouth: and therefore the Book of the <hi>Camicles</hi> doth ſo begin, chap. 2. ver. 1. <hi>Let him kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth;</hi> even becauſe that is the firſt, and the chiefeſt of the Saints deſires in this Life: but if Chriſt wil not kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth, ſaith a gracious ſoul, yet I am willing to kiſs his feet, as <hi>Mary</hi> did. There is a time a coming, when he wil kiſs me with the kiſſes of his mouth for ever; but for the preſent, if I can but kiſs his feet here, I have hope to be kiſſed by him in Heaven. Now I ſay, Did Chriſt ever forſake a man finally, who did thus long after Chriſt himſelf? Can thoſe that are forſaken, mourn after his preſence, as the beſt thing, and for his abſence, as the greateſt evil in al the world? I appeal to your own Souls, and Boſoms herein; whoever you are that labor under this fear, that Chriſt is gone, and he wil return no more; ſuppoſe that God hath hid his face from you, ſeems to forget you, and to be angry with you; yet in the midſt of all theſe darkneſſes, Do you find an evil Spirit, an envious, malicious Spirit from the Lord, ſeizing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you? Do you find, that you can find in your heart to forſake God, and the good Waies of God? Yea, rather, do you not find
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102264:163"/> the contrary, though you want the ſence of Gods Love? Have you not the ſence of your own ſin? and when you want the ſence of your own perfection, have you not ſome ſence of your own imperfection? Don't you look upon this Deſertion, as the greateſt Affliction in al the world? Can you not mourn after God, and his Preſence? Doth not Chriſt every foot, ſend in one token of his Love, or another to viſit your ſouls? And are you not willing to kiſs the feet of Jeſus Chriſt? O yes! I muſt needs ſay; though I have fears that Chriſt is gone, and wil return no more; yet I praiſe the Lord, I do not find an envious, malicious, perſecuting Spirit in my ſoul unto the Saints, and People of God. I don't find that my heart is willing to forſake Chriſt, and the good waies of Chriſt: But I find that I can mourn for the abſence of Chriſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for it ſelf, and look upon it as the greateſt affliction in the world: That I am ever willing to kiſs the feet of Jeſus Chriſt: And to be in the loweſt, and meaneſt Condition, ſo he would but return unto my ſoul again. Yea, and I muſt needs ſay, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very foot I receive one token or other, one Promiſe or another, to viſit me in my condition. Then be of good comfort; though Chriſt be abſent, yet he wil return again; and with great mercy, and with everlaſting kindneſs wil he gather your ſouls unto himſelf again: and thus I ſay it ſhal be with all the Saints. Surely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have no reaſon for their Diſcouragements, whatever their Deſertions be.

O! me thinks every gracious ſoul ſhould ſay, Well, through Grace, I will hearken more to Chriſt: I confeſs indeed, I have heard what Satan hath ſaid; but when Comfort hath come, I have turned away mine Ear, and have not heard; or if I have heard, I have been diſputing againſt what I have heard, and making Objections all along: now the Lord pardon this evil to me; through Grace, mine Ear ſhall be more open to Chriſt, and leſs open to Satan.

It is the Love, and Favor of Chriſt, that you mourn after, and are diſcouraged for the want of; you cannot get a more ready, and compendious way to get this Love, than when you are in the dark, to throw your ſelves into Chriſts Arms at a venture; this takes, and wins the heart of Chriſt over to you: what! will this

Will not ye ſay, ſurely, he that is able to ſtay, is ſtrongeſt? and he the pooreſt, and weakeſt, that is not able to ſtay, or to live by Faith? O! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore labor more and more to live by Faith; and when you are in Deſertion, ſay, Whether ſaved, or not ſaved; whether Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or not Hypocrite, I wil ſtay, I wil wait on God, and let him come when he pleaſeth.

Why do you not ſay to him? this I have heard before, Satan; thou told'ſt me this before, that Chriſt was gone, and would never return again; but I have found it falſe, he did return, and therefore through Grace, I wil never beleeve theſe falſe reports of Chriſt; Chriſt is faithful, I have alwaies found him ſo; thoſe whom he loves, he loves to the end; and I know he loves me, Satan, for I love him; for my love, is but the reflection of his love; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that Gods own People, are apt to be much diſcouraged, by reaſon of their Afflictions, and outward Sufferings.

They are part of Chriſts Purchaſe for you: Look upon <hi>Pauls</hi> Inventory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. <hi>All things are yours; whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or Life, or Death, or things preſent, or things to come:</hi> So that Death it ſelf, the King of Terrors and Afflictions, is here reckoned amongſt the Goods and Chattels, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for you, and left unto you: and if Death be yours, then al Afflictions are yours; and who wil be afraid of that which is his own? 2. They are the Gift of God; <hi>To you it is given, not only to beleeve, but to ſuffer,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. It was the Speech of a good man, now in Heaven, being once under great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; O Lord, theſe Afflictions are thy Pearls, and I wil wear them for thy ſake. 3. They are but ſeeeming Evils; They are real Tryals, and ſeeming Evils. Therfore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction ſeems grievous;</hi> but conſidering altogether, it is rather a <hi>Seeming,</hi> than a real grief: and therefore ſaith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>We are as unknown, and yet well known: as dying, and behold we hee: as chaſtened, and not killed: as ſorrowful, yet alwaies rejoycing: as poor, yet making many rich: as having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things.</hi> In which words, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, he puts a <hi>tanqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When a man takes any Phyſick, he is ſick withal, yet becauſe it is but Phyſick-ſickneſs, you do not call it a ſickneſs; it is <hi>as</hi> a ſickneſs, but not a ſickneſs. Now all the Afflictions of the Saints, are but their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, preſcribed and given them by the hand of their Father; and therefore, though they be ſick therewith, yet it is but <hi>as</hi> a ſickneſs, not ſo indeed, al things rightly weighed. When an unskilful Eye looks upon the threſhing of the Corn, he ſaith, Why do they ſpoil the Corn? But thoſe that know better, ſay, The Flail doth not hurt the Corn; if the Cart-wheel ſhould paſs upon it, there would be ſpoil indeed, but the Flail hurts not. Now there is no Affliction, or ſuffering, that a Godly man meets with, but is Gods Flail: And if you look into <hi>Iſay,</hi> 28. ye ſhal find, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, under a ſimilitude, that his Cart-wheel ſhal not paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

But though mine Affliction be not greater than I can bear, yet if it lie too long upon me (ſay ſome) I ſhall never be able to bear it: Nay, ſaith the Lord, ver. 28. <hi>Bread-Corn is bruiſed, becauſe he will not ever be threſhing it.</hi> But what is this to us? Yes, it is a Parable, for ver. 26. <hi>His God</hi> (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Plow-man) <hi>doth inſtruct him to diſcretion, and doth teach him.</hi> And if the Plow-man have this diſcretion, much more ſhal the Lord himſelf; for verſe 29. <hi>This alſo cometh forth from the Lord of Hoſts, who is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in working.</hi> I am Gods Corn, ſaid the Martyr; I muſt therfore paſs under the Flail, through the Fan, under the Mil-ſtone, into the Oven, before I can be bread for him. And if our Chaff be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from our Graces by this Flail, have we any reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe we are thus afflicted? The truth is, the day of Affliction and Tribulation, is a godly mans Day of Judgment; it is at his Judgment Day, he ſhal never be judged again, ſo as to be condemned at the Day of Judgment; <hi>Ye are judged with the world</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that ye may not be condemned with the world.</hi> And when the Godly mans Affliction-Day is, he may ſay, Now is my Judgment-Day, and I ſhal never be judged again; why therefore ſhould he be diſcouraged, whatever his Afflictions be?</p>

If al the Sufferings of Gods Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do come from Divine Love, the Love of God in Chriſt to them, then have they no reaſon to be diſcouraged, though they be much afflicted: every Rod, is a Rod of Roſemary to them, fruits of their Fathers Love: and if you look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. ye ſhal find, both the thing proved, and the Inference: The thing is proved, at ver. 6. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth:</hi> Which he illuſtrates by a ſimilitude. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man have two Sons; one a Baſtard, and the other Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; he wil rather give Education, and Correction to the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Son, and neglect the Baſtard: and ſaith the Apoſtle, verſe 8. <hi>If ye be without Chaſtiſement, then are ye Baſtards, and not Sons.</hi> What then? verſe 12. <hi>Wherefore, lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees:</hi> As if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, If al the Sufferings, and Afflictions, and Chaſtiſements of the Saints, do proceed from Love, then have they no reaſon to hang down their hands, or heads. But ſo it is, That all their Sufferings come from Love, and therefore no reaſon for their Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly. This wil appear alſo, if you conſider, What comes with the Afflictions of the Saints. There comes much ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace, much Light; much of Gods Preſence, Fëllowſhip and and Communion with Chriſt, in al his Sufferings. Much ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace: <hi>Thy Rod, and thy Staff comforts me.</hi> God never laies a Rod upon his Childrens back, but he firſt puts a Staff into their hand to bear it; and the ſtaff is as big as the Rod: it matters not what your Afflictions be, great, or ſmal, it is al one, you ſhal be upheld; and upholding mercy, is ſomtimes better,<note place="margin">Via Crucis, via Lucis.</note> than a mercy that you are afflicted for the want of. But the Lord doth not only uphold his People under Sufferings, but he gives forth much Light therewithal. The School of the Croſs, is the School of Light. Affliction is our Free-School, where God teacheth his Children, and learns them how to write, both their Sins, and their Graces. Their ſins: So long as Leaves are on the Trees and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, ye cannot ſee the Birds Neſts: But in the Winter, when al the Leaves are off, then ye ſee them plainly. And ſo long as men are in Proſperity, and have their Leaves on, they do not ſee what Neſts of ſins, and luſts, are in their hearts, and lives; but when all their Leaves are off, in the day of their Afflictions, then they ſee them, and ſay, I did not think I had had ſuch Neſts of ſins, and luſts, in my ſoul, and life. <hi>Job,</hi> 36.7. <hi>He withdraweth not his Eye from the Righteous:</hi> Verſe 8. <hi>And if he be bound in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and be holden in Cords of Affliction, then he ſhows them their works, and their trangreſſions, that they have exceeded.</hi> Yea, Affliction do not only diſcover their ſins unto them; but it is Gods Plaiſter, thereby he doth heal the ſame: <hi>Before I was afflicted, I went aſtray,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And <hi>Job,</hi> 36.10. <hi>He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth alſo their Ear to Diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</hi> Yea, theſe Afflictions, and Sufferings of the Saints, do not only diſcover, and heal their ſins; but do put them upon the exerciſe of Grace: <hi>In their Afflictions</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they will ſeek me early.</hi> Yea, they do not only draw out their Graces; but diſcover their Graces too, which poſſibly they did never take notice of before. I have read of ſome fooliſh Youths, that ſitting on the Water ſide, upon the Bank, and mingling their Legs together in the Water, they did not know their own Legs; but one ſtanding by, and ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>g them on the knees with a ſtaff, every one then knew his own Legs, and pulled them up. And ſo it is many times; There is ſuch a likeneſs between Hypocrites common Graces, and the Graces of Gods Children, that the Saints do not know their own Graces; O! ſaith one, it is no more than an Hypocrite may have: but then God ſmites them with ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and ſo they feel, and ſee, and know their own Graces: and good reaſon for it; for when God comes, he diſcovers all:
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102264:168"/> and when is God more preſent with his People, than when they are moſt afflicted? God uſeth to be at the back of Affliction. There Heaven opened to <hi>Stephen.</hi> Afflictions are the ruſty Lock often times, which open the door into the Preſence Chamber. When was Chriſt with the three Children, but in the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? And ye have a ſtanding Promiſe for it; <hi>I will be with thee in the fire, and the water,</hi> ſaith the Lord. And ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Then doth the Spirit of the Lord, and of Glory, reſt upon his Children.</hi> Yea, and as they have moſt of God, when they are moſt afflicted; ſo in time of their Sufferings, they have moſt Communion, and Fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in his Sufferings. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> Chap. 4. Ver. 13. <hi>But rejoyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts Sufferings.</hi> The word <hi>Partaker,</hi> is the ſame that is uſed in <hi>John; Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father:</hi> and the ſame that is uſed in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> concerning the Lords Supper; <hi>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi> You wil al grant, that you have communion with Chriſt at the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but the ſame word being uſed here, ſhows, That you have Communion with Chriſt in his Sufferings alſo; eſpeciall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when you do ſuffer for him: and the greater your Sufferings are, the more fellowſhip, and communion you have with Chriſt in his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: Now then, if al this be true, That a Chriſtian hath Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of Supporting, and Upholding Grace; much Light; his ſin diſcovered, and healed: his Grace exerciſed, and manifeſted: Gods Preſence enjoyed; and made Partaker of the Sufferings of Chriſt, in, and by his Afflictions; what reaſon hath he to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, although he be much afflicted? But ſo it is, That a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath never more Experience of Gods Upholding, Suſtaining Grace: his ſin is never more diſcovered, and healed; his Grace is never more exerciſed, and manifeſted: God is never more preſent with him, than when he is moſt afflicted: and he is never more partaker of Chriſts ſufferings, than in, and by his Sufferings: Surely therefore, he hath no reaſon for his Diſcouragements, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Afflictions be.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: This wil appear, if you conſider, The Fruit, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, End, and Iſſue of your Afflictions, and what they bring forth, <hi>They bring forth the quiet fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Triumph over Satan; for now poor <hi>Job</hi> may ſay, Satan, thou ſaid'ſt, I did not ſerve God for nought; but now the contrary appears. Yea, <hi>They work out an exceeding, eternal weight of Glory.</hi> And if you look into <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. where we are commanded, <hi>To work out our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with fear, and trembling:</hi> you ſhal find, it is the ſame word that is uſed here concerning Afflictions; that they work out an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, eternal weight of Glory. Now if al my Afflictions do

Thus it is with al the Saints and People of God; though their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings may ſeem to be grievous for the preſent, yet they bring forth the quiet fruits of Righteouſneſs; thereby the Saints tryumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Satan; and theſe Sufferings work out an exceeding, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory. Surely therefore, a Godly, Gracious man, hath no reaſon to be diſcouraged, whatever his Affliction be.</p>

And if God your Father ſee, that you have been, or would be drunk with your own Comforts; have you any hurt, that he hath taken them from you for a time? When a wiſe Father, ſees that his Child fals in love with his Maid, one that is much beneath him; doth his Father do him any wrong, that he removes her from him, or him out of her ſight? It may be the preſent Affection of the Child ſaith, my Father deals hardly by me: but wil the Childs Reaſon ſay ſo afterwards? No, but he wil rather ſay, at ſuch a time I fel in love with my Fathers Servant, and if my Father had not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her out of my ſight, I had been loſt, and undone for ever.

Affliction is Gods Soap; before a godly man goes into Afflictions, his very Graces are mixed with ſin; his Faith is mixed, and dirtied with Unbelief, and doubtings; his Humility with Pride; his Zeal with Luke-warmneſs: but now, by his Tribulation, his Garments, and Robes are made white, and waſhed, and he ſhall be of a more royal ſpirit, and be cloathed with Robes: But though the Lord make uſe of my Tribulations, thus to waſh; yet I fear that by theſe publick Calamities, I ſhall be driven from Ordinances, the Temple, and Worſhip of God; nay, ſaith he therefore at verſe 15. <hi>They are before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple.</hi> But what though we have the Ordinances, if Chriſt be not preſent with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He ads therefore, <hi>And he that ſits on the Throne, ſhall dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us.</hi> But though we have the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we may ſuffer much with want: true, yet verſe 16. <hi>They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhal the Sun light on them, nor any heat; for the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne, ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Water.</hi> O! but yet we may be brought in the mean while into grievous ſtreits, and be in a ſad, and mournful Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. True, but there is a time a coming, when all tears ſhall be wiped away from our Eyes; and therefore he ads this at verſe 17. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their Eyes.</hi> How ſhould tears be wiped away hereafter, if they were not ſhed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? Though then you do fear it now, and ſhed many tears, yet all ſhall be wiped away, and not one left. O! what gracious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is here! Thus will Chriſt deal with his People in trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times; and therefore though our condition in regard of the Publick, be exceeding ſad, and very grievous, inſomuch as we have all cauſe to mourn, and weep; yet if you be in Chriſt, and have made your Peace with God, you have no reaſon to be caſt down. And thus it is with every godly man; ſurely therefore, a godly, gracious man, hath no reaſon for his diſcouragements, whatever his Affliction be.</p>

So ſay I; though your Afflictions be great, and ſeem to ſwallow up all your Comforts; yet your Comforts ſhall not be buried in them; for if Godly, you are riſen with Chriſt, and have fellowſhip with him, and ſo die no more: When therefore Affliction comes, rejoyce in that you are made partakers of his Sufferings; and ſay, Rejoyce not over me, O mine Enemy; for though I fall, yet I ſhal riſe again, for by my Sufferings, I have fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Sufferings, and ſo in his Reſurrection, Comforts, and Glories.</p>

I was converted (ſaid one, telling the ſtory of his Converſion) by ſeeing a man executed; for thought I, if a man be thus puniſhed with death for breaking one of the Laws of men, what do I then deſerve, who have broken all the Laws of God? Affliction ſomtimes teacheth the by-ſtander much; but eſpecially it is teaching to your ſelf, thereby you ſee and read the fulneſs of God, the emptineſs of the Creature, and the vileneſs of ſin; it recals ſin paſt, and prevents ſin to come; it quickens prayer, and enlarges thankfulneſs; and it may be thou mayeſt owe thy Converſion to ſome Affliction, as a means thereof; and if ſo much good do come by it, will you be diſcouraged under it?

When men loſe a mercy, they only conſider the ſweetneſs of a mercy loſt, and not the burden that they do loſe withal. O! ſaith a poor woman, I have loſt my Husband, ſo loving, ſo gracious, ſo help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but not a word of the burden that is gone withal, and ſo there is much diſcouragement. When Affliction comes, men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the evil, and not the mercy that doth come withal, and ſo they are much dejected. Suppoſe that a loving Father in ſome high room, throw down a bag of Gold to his Child, and it lights on the Childs head, inſomuch as it breaketh his head, and cauſeth blood to come; whilſt the Child feels the ſmart thereof, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, and froward; while he looks only upon the Leathern bag, he is not thankful; but when he looks into the bag, and ſees
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102264:174"/> what a great deal of gold his Father hath given him, then he ſpeaks well of his Father, notwitſtanding all the ſmart of his head. There is never an Affliction, but is a bag of Gold given unto the People of God; though it ſeem a Leathern Bag without, yet there is Gold within: ſo long as they ſtand poring upon the Leathern Bag, or attend unto the ſmart of their Affliction, they are not thankful, they do not praiſe the Lord, but are much diſcouraged; but if they would look into the Bag, and tel their Gold, then they would have Comfort, and not be diſcouraged. I tell you from the Lord, there is Gold within; look into this Bag, the Bag of Affliction, tell over all your Gold which the Lord hath given you in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and then you will be quiet. If a mercy be taken from you, Conſider the burden that is taken away too. If a miſery come, Conſider the mercy that doth come withal, labor ever, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ſee both together, as well what is for you, as what is againſt you; then will you never be much diſcouraged, although your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction be never ſo great.</p>

                  <p>But now, Take a godly mans Condition, and though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſad, yet there is no reaſon why he ſhould be diſcouraged, or caſt down becauſe of his Condition, in it ſelf conſidered. For,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> By way of Demonſtration. Firſt: If his Condition be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out unto him by the hand of his Father, who is of infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and love; then he hath no reaſon to complain, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. Now look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, and Chriſt of the Saints, at verſe 6. <hi>My lines are fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in a pleaſant place; yea, I have a fair Heritage, or a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heritage;</hi> Why? (verſe 5.) <hi>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup.</hi> Three Things are moſt conſiderable
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102264:185" rendition="simple:additions"/> here. Firſt, Theſe words are plainly ſpoken of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior Chriſt, and of his great Sufferings, as appears by verſe 10. <hi>For thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy One to ſee Corruption. Men, and Brethren</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.29.) <hi>Let me ſpeak unto you of the Patriark</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day; therefore being a Prophet, and God had ſworn unto him, that of the fruit of his Loyns according to the Fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne; he ſeeing this before, ſpake of the reſurrection of Chriſt.</hi> At verſe 27. of the 2d chapter, ye have the ſame words that you have here in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell; neither wilt thou ſuffer thine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One to ſee corruption.</hi> So that plainly, the words of the Pſalm are ſpoken of Chriſt, and of his great Sufferings. But now in the Second place; Though his Sufferings were very great and many, yet ſaith he, <hi>My lines are fallen unto me in a pleaſant place, and I have a goodly Heritage;</hi> But why ſo? The Reaſon is (in the Third place) in verſe 5. <hi>The Lord is the portion of my Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of my Cup;</hi> the Lord, my Father, ſaith he, hath drawn out my lines for me, he hath meaſured out my condition, and the Lord himſelf is my portion, and the portion of mine Inheritance. Thus now, may every godly man ſay; My lines are fallen unto me in a pleaſant place, yea, I have a goodly Heritage; Why? for the Lord is the Portion of mine Inheritance, and of my Cup; Surely, therefore he hath no reaſon to be diſcouraged, whatever his Condition be. Again,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly: If a man do not live upon his Condition it ſelf, but upon his call into his Condition; then he hath no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in regard of his Condition it ſelf. Now as our Lord and Savior Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Man lives not by Bread, but by every Word of God;</hi> ſo ſay I, Man lives not upon his Condition, but upon Gods Call into his Condition; and if God cal a man into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he wil maintain him in it: therefore you find thoſe two go together, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou maintaineſt my Lot;</hi> at the latter end of verſe 5. <hi>And my lines are fallen to me in a pleaſant place.</hi> And thus it was with the Children of Iſrael, when they went through the red Sea; it is ſaid, <hi>The Waters ſtood like a wall on each ſide of them:</hi> ye never read before, of a wall of water, and yet then the waters were as a wall unto them; a ſtrange kind of Wall made of Waters; but ſaith the Text, <hi>The Waters were as a Wall,</hi> ſtood as a Wall on each ſide of them. Beloved, Gods Call, is our Wall; which wil bear off, and bear up ones heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der troubles, and diſcouragements. O! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith a gracious ſoul, what abundance of oppoſition do I meet withal in my Condition; but yet the Lord hath called me into this Condition, and therefore
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102264:185"/> I am quiet, I am contented, I am ſatisfied; I confeſs I did not think to have met with ſo much Affliction in my Condition as now I do; but God hath called me into it, and therefore I have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Thus it is with al the Saints, they are led by Gods Call into their Condition, and they can ſhew their Patent, they can ſay, here is my Call. Now, if a man do not live upon the Condition it ſelf, but upon Gods Call into his Condition; and God doth cal his People into whatſoever condition they are; then they have no reaſon to be diſcouraged by reaſon of their Condition. Again,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly: If there be no Condition that a godly man can fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but there is ſome mercy that is mixed with it, and Jeſus Chriſt hath paid for that too; then a man hath no reaſon to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, whatever his condition be. Now you know what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith; <hi>Shall a living man complain? is not a living Dog, better than a dead Lyon?</hi> Some Mercy ſtil that is mixed with Miſery, and Jeſus Chriſt hath paid the Reckoning; godly men have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to pay, not any thing to pay. Suppoſe you were invited to a great Feaſt, and ſome of the Diſhes were not ſo wel dreſſed or cooked up, as you deſire; would you find fault? would you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain? No; Why? Becauſe this feaſt doth coſt me nothing: the Maſter of the Feaſt may find fault, but I am a Gueſt, and it coſt me nothing, and therefore I have no reaſon to complain. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the great Maſter of the Feaſt, and of al the Comforts which you have, and he hath paid all your recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, there is nothing for you to pay; and if you bring in your Prayers, your Tears, your Obedience, as matter of Payment, they wil not be taken; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o, ſaith Chriſt, I have paid al my ſelf, witneſs theſe empty Purſes, theſe empty Veins of mine; as for you, O my Friends, ye are welcom, but you have nothing to pay, not a penny, not a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thing. I ſay, there is no condition that a godly man can fal into, but there is ſome mercy that is mixed withal, and Chriſt hath paid the reckoning for the mercy too; ſurely then, the People or God have no reaſon to be diſcouraged by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their condition.</p>

                     <hi>But</hi> (wil ſome ſay) <hi>I am in a poor, low, mean, baſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed condition, and therefore I am thus diſquieted; as for thoſe that are in a proſperous eſtate and condition, they may well bear up their heads, and be of good comfort: Rich men indeed, and thoſe that are in a proſperous condition, have many opportunities of ſerving God, publickly, and privately, which a poor man hath not; they have time to frequent the Ordinances in the week, to converſe much with God in private, whilſt the poor man is fain to be at work for his living, and glad he can get his living too;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102264:186"/> there is no man knows the miſery of a poor condition, but thoſe that are in it: and ſuch is my condition and, therefore I am thus diſcouraged; have I not cauſe and reaſon for it?</hi>

                     </label> No: for whoſoever you are that ſpeak, or think thus; Do you know what the burden of Proſperity is? You ſee a Town ſomtimes upon the ſide of a Hill, and you ſay, what a fine Town is there, what pleaſant Meadows are about it, what excellent Woods, what clean Waies unto it: Thus you ſpeak at a diſtance: But when you draw neer unto this Town, and go through ſome of the Lanes, you find them very dirty, and then you ſay, I did not think at a diſtance, that there had been ſuch a dirty Lane about this Town; I ſaw nothing but fine, and clean Meadows when I was at a diſtance, I did not think there had been ſuch dirty paſſages to it. So, when you look upon Proſperity at a diſtance, you think there is no dirty Lanes, no foul Paſſages to it, and from it; but when you come neer unto it, then you find many a dirty paſſage, and you ſay, O! what dirty ſloughs are here? The Truth is, the more Proſperous (I ſpeak now of outward Proſperity) a mans Condition is, the more opportunities he hath, of doing, and receiving good. But if you look into <hi>Numbers,</hi> 4. you ſhal find, That every opportunity of Service carries a burden with it; and therefore the Service of the Levites, is often, and in many verſes of the Chapter, called a burden: I wil name but one, which is the laſt; <hi>According to the Commandement of the Lord, they were numbered by the hand of</hi> Moſes, <hi>every one according to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and according to his Burden:</hi> Service, and Burden, do here go together; Burden, and Service; Service, and Burden. And now poor ſoul, is it a burden to you, that you are freed from a burden? hath not our Lord and Savior Chriſt ſaid, and do you not find it in Experience, <hi>That the poor receive the Goſpel?</hi> is not a living Sprig of a Tree, better than a dead Arm? The poor Hen (you know) ſo long as ſhe lives, is upon the Dunghil, and there ſhe is ſcraping, and picking up her living; but when ſhe is dead, then ſhe is brought unto the Maſters Table. The Hawk on the contrary, while he is living, is carryed upon the Fiſt, and upon the Arm, and hath good fleſh, and proviſion made for him, and a houſe to ſit in; but when the Hawk dieth, then he is thrown out unto the Dunghil. So in this caſe; ſo long as a poor, godly man is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here, it may be he is upon the Dunghil, and picking up his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a little, and a little; but when he dieth, then he is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maſters preſence. But the rich, ungodly man, when he dieth (though while he lived, he had great proviſion) yet then he is thrown out unto the Dunghil, and comes no more into his Maſters Preſence. O! you that are godly, though in a low condition, would you then change your condition with the wicked? The
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102264:186" rendition="simple:additions"/> lower your Condition is, the higher is your Obedience; if you ſubmit unto the work of your Condition, this is Angelical Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for the Angels, though in order of Nature, they are above Men, yet at the Command of God, they are miniſtring Spirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Men, attend, and look to Men, that are much below them in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and the lower the work is, that they do in tending Men, the higher is their Obedience to God.

It was the Speech of a good man that is now in Heaven; The more Riches, the more Debts: for if a man be not in Chriſt, al his preſent Riches wil be future Debts; he wil wiſh, O! that I had had leſs of them, O! that I had had never a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And I pray tel me, who have moſt Promiſes in Scripture? the Poor, or the Rich? the Oppreſſed, or the Oppreſſor? the High, or the Low? He that is moſt exerciſed, hath the moſt Promiſes; and a low Condition, is an excellent Commentary upon thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. When the Sun ſhines, ye ſee not the Stars; but in the night, the Stars appear. So, whilſt Proſperity ſhines upon us, we do not ſee the Promiſes; but when the night comes, Adverſity comes, a dark and low Condition comes, then we ſee thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes which we ſaw not before. But ſuppoſe that a Father hath two Children, and to one he gives a brave Garment, ſaying unto him; Child, take, and wear this Garment; but there is all thy Portion, I ſhall give thee no more. The other he gives a mean Garment to; but ſaith he, Child, be contented, it is nor thy Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thy Brothers Garment is his Portion; but though thy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be mean, it is not thy Portion, I have a good Inheritance for thee: Will not this latter Child be contented? will he be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged think you, becauſe he hath not ſo brave a Garment as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath? Why, take a wicked man, and though he have a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Garment, yet it is all his Portion, his Portion is in this Life, there is all thou ſhalt have, ſaith God, there is thy Portion. But now, as for a godly man, though he have a mean Garment, yet it is not his portion. O! you that are godly, wil you then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, becauſe you have not ſo brave, and fine a Garment as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath? Conſider, that the Lord himſelf is your Portion.</p>

Now I pray, why doth the Lord ſuffer the Condition of his People to be ſo unſettled in the world, but that they may ſettle upon himſelf? O! ſaith a gracious heart, I ſee there is no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding place here, therefore I look for one that is to come, that hath a Foundation: had I been ſettled in the world, I ſhould never have been fixed upon God himſelf; but being unſettled in the world, I learn to ſettle upon God himſelf: God doth therefore carry his Children from Veſſel to Veſſel, from Condition to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that their filthy ſcent may not remain. Beloved, there is no condition here below, that is able to graſp, or hold the Love of God to his Children; every Condition is too narrow a Veſſel to hold the Love of God in, and therefore God doth lead his People into ſeveral Conditions, that ſo he may have the ſuller vent for his Love: So long as you are in one Condition, you do not ſee, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your own ſelf, and carriage therein, and therefore God leads you into a new Condition, that you may ſee what you did in your former Condition. For Example: When a man is in health, he doth not then obſerve his own carriage in the daies of Health; therefore God leads him into ſickneſs, and when he is ſick, then he doth obſerve what his carriage was while he was in health; then ſaith he, how wanton was I, how worldly was I, how vain was I, when I was in health: But when a man is ſick, then he doth not obſerve his carriage in that Condition; therefore Gods leads him into health again, and when he is in health, then he ſeeth what his carriage was while he was ſick; and then ſaith he, how froward was I, how impatient was I when I was ſick. I ſay, a man doth not obſerve the preſent carriage of his ſoul in his preſent condition, and therefore God leads him into a new Condition, and then he ſees what his carriage was in the old condition. Phyloſophy tels us,<note place="margin">Senſibile po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitum juxta ſenſorium nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſit ſenſatio.</note> That if a ſenſible Object be laid cloſe to the Organ of Sence, there wil be no ſenſation; as if a Book be held cloſe unto your eye, you wil not be able to read a letter; but hold it at a convenient
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102264:187"/> diſtance, and then you may read it al. So here; ſo long as a man is in a condition, and that is held cloſe unto him, he doth not ſee his own carriage therein, but at a diſtance he doth; wherefore the Lord doth remove him to ſome diſtance from his former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo he ſees, and obſerveth what he was, and did therein. It is an eaſie thing for a man to ſing when the Pſalm is ſet, a Child can do it; but it requires ſome skil to begin, it requires ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging skil to turn readily from one tune to another; but when the Pſalm is begun, every one can go on then. A poor weak Horſe can go on in the Road, ſo long as he keeps the ſame way; but when he comes to turn out of that way into another, then he ſtumbles; it requires ſome ſtrength in a Horſe to go readily over the Cart-wracks, to go readily from one way into another, this requires ſtrength. So every poor, weak man, may go on in the ſame way, and in the ſame condition, this requires no great ſtore of ſtrength; but to carry the ſameneſs of heart towards God in variety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, this argues ſtrength, this requires skil: What therefore if the Lord wil lead you from one condition to another, and ſo draw out your skil, and ſtrength, and hath no deſign but of Love upon you, wil you then be diſcouraged? Thus it is with all the Saints; ſurely therefore they have no reaſon to be caſt down in this reſpect.</p>

God doth alwaies give ſome opportunities of good unto his People; either of doing good, or receiving good; and the leſs opportunity they have of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving good, uſually the more opportunity they have of doing good: what though your hand be empty of receiving opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

When <hi>Jonah</hi> was in the Whales belly, he prayed; and in his prayer, he looked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Temple, though he was abſent from it, and the Lord heard his prayer. And Beloved, if the Lord do remember your carriage, labor of Love, Longings, Groanings, Mournings after the Ordinances, as much when you want them, as he remembers your enlargements under them; then you have no reaſon to be diſcouraged in this reſpect. Now look into <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132. and you ſhal ſee how <hi>David</hi> preſſeth the Lord to remember him, verſe 1. <hi>Lord, remember</hi> David, <hi>and all his afflictions;</hi> he was in great Afflictions, and he deſired the Lord to remember him; but under what Notion would he have the Lord remember him? why ſaith he, remember him? <hi>How he ſware unto the Lord</hi> (verſe 2.) <hi>and vowed unto the mighty God of</hi> Jacob; <hi>ſurely</hi> I <hi>will not come into the Tabernacle of my Houſe, nor go up into my Bed;</hi> I <hi>will not give ſleep to mine eyes, or ſlumber to mine eye-lids, until</hi> I <hi>have found out a place for the Lord, an Habitation for the mighty God of</hi> Jacob. He wanted the Ordinance, and his heart was reſtleſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; and now he deſires the Lord to remember him for this. So that I ſay, God wil in a ſpecial manner remember your carriage; labor of Love, longings, and groanings after Ordinances when you want them. O! but though the Lord do remember us in due time; yet what ſhal we do in the mean time? Mark what follows; at verſe 6. <hi>Lo, we heard of it at</hi> Ephrata, <hi>we found it in the fields of the woods;</hi> What is that? <hi>Lo, we heard of it at</hi> Ephrata; we heard of it, that is, we heard of the Ark (which he had ſpoken of before) and the Habitation of the mighty God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> We heard of it at <hi>Ephrata;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, it was commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and thought, that the Lord would ſettle his Ark, and his Houſe, and Habitation at <hi>Ephrata,</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> a plentiful place; but now we have found it in the fields of the Wood. Now we find that the Lord wil ſettle his Houſe, and his Ark at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is compaſſed about with Hills full of Woods; in the Fields of the Forreſt have we found it. Beloved, our eye is all upon <hi>Ephrata,</hi> upon <hi>Bethlebem,</hi> upon the plentiful place; but the Lord doth ſo order things in his Goodneſs, that when he brings his People into the Woods, the Fields, the Forreſt, there they find his Ark, his Preſence, and his Habitation in the midſt of it. And what godly man is there, whom God hath called at any time from the Ordinance, but he may ſay thus; Lo, we heard of it at <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> but we have found it in the Fields of the Woods; and if you do not find the Preſence of God, and the Ark of God, and his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation at <hi>Ephrata;</hi> yet if ye find him in the Fields of the Woods,

Becauſe by Grace they were ſaved: So that Free Grace, is that diſtinguiſhing Mercy of God, whereby he doth ſhew mercy to ſome, and not to others, who are alike miſerable, and unworthy. But now this Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption, tels us, That as Chriſt died for all, ſo he doth give a ſufficiency of Grace unto all, and therefore that which diſtinguiſheth one man from another, muſt be the free Will of man, and not the free Grace of God; for, <hi>Commune quae tenus, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne non diſtinguit;</hi> That which is common, as common, cannot diſtinguiſh. As ſuppoſe now, that a Father doth beſtow an equal Sum of Money upon two Children, to purchaſe Houſe or Land with; one doth purchaſe, and the other not: the reaſon why the one purchaſes, and the other not, is, Becauſe the one wills it, and the other not; indeed he that purchaſeth, doth it by his Fathers help, aſſiſtance, and Money; but what reaſon is there why he doth make a Purchaſe, and the other not, but becauſe he wils it, and the other not?

Now where Free Will hath the caſting Vote, there the Free Grace of God doth not raign: but according to the Doctrine of Univerſal Redemption, Free Will is that which doth make the difference between man and man, it is that which hath the caſting Voyce; ſurely therefore, it is no friend, but a real enemy to the free Grace of God, and ſo an enemy to the comfort of a poor doubting ſoul.</p>

Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the Name of the Lord, do I here this morning, lay before this Congregation, Life, and Death; Encouragement on the one hand, and Diſcouragement on the other hand; and if there be an Adulterer, a Swearer, a Lying Child, or a Stealing Servant; if there be ever a poor Wanton, a Sabbath-breaker, an Oppoſer of God here: I beſeech you in the Lord, come unto Jeſus Chriſt, by all theſe Encouragements that I have been ſpeaking of, by all the Mercies of the new Covenant, and by the Salvation of thine own ſoul: man, or woman, I beſeech you come unto Jeſus Chriſt. O! that men, and women, would give no reſt unto themſelves, til they have made their Peace with God, and til they have gotten into Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And in caſe that you be in Chriſt, and that you do beleeve, that you be godly, and have made your Peace with God. Then ſee
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102264:195"/> that ye walk up unto all theſe Encouragements, ſee that you walk in the Comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. O! you that are Godly (if theſe things be as you have heard) Why hang you down your heads? why are you caſt down, and diſquieted? why do you not walk in the comforts of this Truth declared, and in the ſtrength of theſe Encouragements? You ſee what a venture we have run to ſpeak comfort to you that want comfort. You have heard in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Exerciſes, That a godly man hath no reaſon for his Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, whatever his condition be: Not in regard of ſin: Not in regard of Failings, and ſucceſsleſsneſs in Duties: Not in regard of want of Aſſurance: Not in regard of Temptation: Not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Affliction: Not in regard of Deſertion: And now, not in regard of his Condition, in it ſelf conſidered. Now after all this, I appeal to you, you that are without comfort, Do you not think, that there are ſome wicked men in this Congregation, that have preſumed, when they have heard theſe things preached, and have ſaid, Theſe things belong to me; and ſo have endangered their own ſouls by preſumption, comforting themſelves when they ſhould not be comforted? I appeal to you, Whether you do not think, That there are ſome wicked men in the Congregation, that have thus endangered their ſouls by miſ-application of theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations? And if ſo, that there hath been this hazard run, and all to comfort you; then, will you now refuſe this comfort? O! you that have refuſed comfort al this while, receive it in the Lord; and you that were never comforted before, now comfort your ſelves, and walk in the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. And you that have gone up and down fearing, trembling, doubting, and much diſcouraged; yet now at the laſt ſay: <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope in God, wait on God, truſt in God; for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my Countenance, and my God.</hi> How you ſhould ſo hope, and wait, and truſt in God, as to bear up your hearts againſt all diſcouragements, I ſhall yet ſpeak to, in the next Exerciſe.</p>

Properly, according to Scripture Phraſe, Truſting in God, is the Recumbency, or the Relyance of the ſoul upon God in Chriſt for ſome good thing that lies out of ſight.

And then I ſay, it is the Relyance, or the ſtayance of the ſoul upon God in Chriſt; and ſo I take it to be meant here: for the word here tranſlated <hi>[God]</hi> Hope, or Truſt <hi>[in God]</hi> is in the plural number, <hi>Elohim;</hi> and ſo when the Prophet in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. doth exhort unto Truſting in the Lord; he gives this reaſon, at verſe 4. <hi>For in the Lord</hi> Jehovah, is <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtrength;</hi> ſo you read it: but according to the Hebrew, thus; <hi>Truſt in the Lord for ever, for in</hi> Jehovah jah <hi>is everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſtrength.</hi> For in <hi>Jehovah jah: Jah,</hi> is an abridgment, or an abreviation of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> noting the Son of God; and ſo when Jeſus Chriſt comes in the latter end of the world, to ſit upon his glorious Throne, the converting Jew ſhal praiſe him under that name, ſinging (as you read in <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.) <hi>Halelujah;</hi> praiſe the <hi>Jah:</hi> which if you compare with <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 68. you ſhal find, is to be underſtood of Chriſt, at verſe 4. <hi>Sing unto God, ſing praiſes to his Name; extol him that rides upon the Heavens, by his Name</hi> Jah; <hi>rejoyce before him, extol him that rideth upon the Heavens, by his Name</hi> Jah; and they ſhal ſing <hi>Hallelujah.</hi> Now if you look into the 18. verſe of that <hi>Pſalm,</hi> you ſhal find the reaſon why this <hi>Jah,</hi> is to be praiſed: for ſaith the Pſalm, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou haſt led Captivity captive, thou haſt received Gifts for men:</hi> Which words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. are applied to Chriſt: <hi>But unto every one of us, is given according to the meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt:</hi> verſe 8. <hi>Wherefore he ſaith, when he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive, and gave Gifts unto men.</hi> So that when the Prophet doth exhort us to truſt in <hi>Jehovah Jah,</hi> he exhorteth us to truſt in the Lord, in Chriſt; and therefore I ſay, both according to the old, and new Teſtament, Faith is the repoſe, or recumbency of the ſoul upon God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But yet, that is not all: A man that doth repoſe upon God in Chriſt, truſting in him, doth truſt unto him for ſome good thing that lies out of ſight; and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>Faith is the Evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11. where he gives divers Inſtances of <hi>Abraham, Sarah, Moſes,</hi> and others, who all did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon God for ſomwhat that lay out of view; and this indeed is only worthy of the name of Faith. I will truſt a man that is moſt unworthy, I will truſt a Thief, I will truſt a Lyer, ſo far as I can ſee him. But as <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſaith well, this is <hi>Fides Deo digna,</hi> Faith worthy of God, to repoſe on God for ſomwhat that lies out of ſight, and out of view: and when a man doth thus ſtay himſelf upon God in Chriſt, for ſomwhat that lies out of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:102264:197"/> ſight, then he is ſaid to truſt in God; and when a man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus, then he is ſaid for to wait on God. This is the Firſt. But then,</p>

Yea, the Lord doth not only engage to give Peace unto ſuch a ſoul, but to keep him in Peace; <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect Peace,</hi> or in Peace, Peace; and all upon this account, Becauſe he truſteth in thee; not becauſe he prayed, not becauſe he humbled hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ye know, that if ye have a buſineſs depending at Law, though for the preſent you be much troubled about it; yet, if you have a Friend, a Lawyer that is able, faithful, and willing to look to it; if you can but leave your buſineſs with him, it doth very much quiet your heart; the very leaving your buſineſs with him, doth quiet your mind. So here. If a man can but leave his buſineſs, and his Cauſe,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102264:197"/> and his Things with God; then he is at reſt, and he may ſay, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto thy reſt, O my ſoul,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did; which is done by Faith. And to cleer this a little, Three or Four things there are that do ordinarily cauſe diſquietude, or diſcouragement. Firſt, The darkneſs that is in the Underſtanding; for when a man is in the dark, eſpecially if he be alone, he is very apt to be skared, and to be diſquieted. Secondly, Inordinate, and unruly Affections, and Paſſions, eſpecially that of Fear, whereby the ſoul is benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thirdly, Guilt of Conſcience: Though there be much water that doth beat upon the Ship at Sea, yet it ſinketh not; but when there is a leak, a hole in the Ship, then the Ship ſinketh, and the water doth become its grave: So, though there be many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that beat upon a man, yet his heart doth not ſink; but when there is a leak in his Conſcience, when there is a hole there, when a man hath a guilty Conſcience, then he ſinketh, and his heart fails him. And Fourthly, The apprehenſion of Gods Greatneſs, with our diſtance from him. Now Faith cures all this; for in oppoſition to the firſt, of Darkneſs, Faith brings Light into the ſoul, and ſhews a man his Way, and his Warrant for what he doth. Secondly, It doth pare, and take off thoſe inordinate, and unruly affections, and paſſions that are in the ſoul; and therefore in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37. at ver. 1. and 7. you ſhal find that fretting and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting are ſet in oppoſition: <hi>Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of the evil Doer,</hi> verſe 3. <hi>but truſt in the Lord.</hi> And again verſe 7. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him; fret not thy ſelf becauſe of him who prospereth in his way.</hi> Thirdly, It doth heal the Conſcience, and purifie that, therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let us draw neer with aſſurance of Faith, having our Conſciences sprinkled, &amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. Fourthly, It doth alſo bring the ſoul neer to God; the great work of faith is to bring God and the ſoul together. So you have it in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs, and acceſs with confidence, by the faith of him:</hi> Faith gives a man acceſs unto God, and brings him neer unto God. But a man may come neer unto God, &amp; yet he may fear, and tremble, as the Jews d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now to ſhew with what boldneſs a Chriſtian, and a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, comes into the preſence of God by Chriſt through Faith, as if all Vails were taken off; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We come with open face;</hi> and <hi>we all with open face behold, as in a Glaſs, the Mirror of the Lord.</hi> And upon this account, a Beleever may now come with more boldneſs into the preſence of God, than <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency: for though <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency had no Vail, or Covering of Guilt thrown over his face; yet there was a great diſtance between God and him. But now, ſince the Fall, ſince Chriſts time, God is come into our Nature, manifeſted in the Fleſh; and ſo God is come neer to us, and by Faith we do draw neer to God: no wonder therefore, that the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>by Faith we have boldneſs, and acceſs with Confidence.</hi> Faith tels a man, that God is come neer to him, and he is come neer to God; and therefore Faith certainly, is the great Remedy, and means againſt all diſcouragements that can ariſe.</p>

Let him truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> Firſt, It is poſſible for one that is the Servant of God to be in darkneſs, and in ſuch a dark condition, where no light, nor no comfort is. Secondly, When he is in this dark Condition, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do ariſe (the Commandement is moſt expreſs) then he is to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God. So alſo our Savior Chriſt commands his Diſciples, <hi>John,</hi> 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, you beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me.</hi> There was a great Cloud ariſing upon Chriſts Diſciples, Chriſt to be taken from them by Death; the Shepheard to be ſtricken, and the Sheep ſcattered: Now the only means againſt trouble that Chriſt preſcribes, is this; <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me;</hi> and he gives many Arguments to preſs thereunto, in this 14.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102264:198"/> Chriſt was now to die, and to bear the ſin of many, and to lie under the ſence of his Fathers wrath, and diſpleaſure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaith, that his heart was heavy unto death; but though it was the time of his own trouble, yet he addreſſeth himſelf to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his Diſciples againſt their trouble; and the only means and remedy that he doth preſcribe, is this; <hi>Ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me?</hi> So that I ſay, when Diſcouragements do ariſe, it is the Duty of all Chriſts Diſciples, then, and then eſpecially, for to truſt in God by Chriſt: for I pray, what is Faith made for? but for ſuch a time as this is? every Grace is to be exerciſed in its ſeaſon. If a man have ſinned, then he is to repent, that is the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for his Repentance: If a man have received any mercy from God, then he is to be thankful; that is the ſeaſon of Thankfulneſs: If another poor Chriſtian be in want, then he is to exerciſe his Charity; that is the ſeaſon of that Grace of Charity: If Gods Face do ſhine upon a man, then he is to rejoyce; that is the ſeaſon of Spiritual Joy: If a man be given to wantonneſs, and have a beautiful Object laid before him, then he is to exerciſe Chaſtity; and that is a ſeaſon for it: So, when Diſcouragements do ariſe, then he is to exerciſe Faith; and that is the ſeaſon, the proper time and ſeaſon for it: For it is not only our Duty to bring forth Fruit, but we muſt bring forth Fruit in its ſeaſon:<note place="margin">Pſalm, 1.2.</note> Now this is the proper ſeaſon for Faith to work in, when all a mans Comforts are out of ſight: and therefore when Diſcouragements do ariſe, then, and then eſpecially, the Saints, and the People of God, are to exerciſe their Faith.</p>

If a man be in Temptation, then he loſeth the ſight of his former Experiences, and ſo he is much diſcouraged. If a man be under a Deſertion, he loſeth the ſight of what is preſent, what God is to him, and what he is to God; and ſo he is diſcouraged. If a man be under an Affliction, he loſeth the ſight of what is to come; the end, and the iſſue of the Affliction, and ſo he is diſquieted. But

Now, it's only Faith that ſhews a man the end, and the iſſue of all his troubles. It ſtands upon the high Tower of the Threatening, and Promiſe, ſeeing over al Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Difficulties; it ſeeth into the other World; it ſees through Death, and beyond Death; it ſees through Affliction, and beyond Affliction; it ſeeth through Temptation, and beyond Temptation; it ſeeth through Deſertion, and beyond Deſertion; it ſeeth through Gods Anger, and beyond his Anger: I ſay, it ſeeth things paſt, preſent, and to come. Now, if a man had ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as he were able to fetch in al his former experiences, to ſee things preſent as they are; and to ſee all the events, and iſſues of things to come, would he not be quiet, notwithſtanding all that might ariſe for the preſent?

In times of the old Teſtament, they came to Chriſt by the Promiſe, becauſe Chriſt was not then come, but promiſed: now Chriſt is come, we come to the Promiſes by Chriſt.

Wherein was their Unbelief? They did not truſt God for meat in the Wilderneſs: why, but that had been a miracle to have Meat in the Wilderneſs; true, yet this was their Unbelief, That they did not truſt God for Meat in the Wilderneſs. Again, they ſinned, and did not truſt God for Water: why, but it was a miracle for them to have Water in that place, where no Water was naturally; true, yet becauſe the Lord had led them in a way of miracles before, they ſinned now in that they did not truſt God for miracles; and it was as great a ſin that they did not truſt God for Miracles, being led in a way of Miracles, as that they did not truſt God for ordinary mercies, when the Lord led them in waies of ordinary mercies.

When a man comes to go over a River, though he ride once, and again into the Water, and comes out, ſaying, I fear it is too deep for me; yet conſidering that there is no other way for him, he reſolves to venture; for ſaith he, the longer I ſtay, the higher the Waters wil riſe, and there is no other way for me, and I muſt through at the laſt, as good at the firſt, as at the laſt; and ſo he doth venture through, and is ſafe. Thus it is here. You muſt venture upon Chriſt at the laſt, there is no other way but venturing upon Jeſus Chriſt, thou muſt do it at the laſt; and were it not as good for you to do it at the firſt, as at the laſt?

                     <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaith, As men are puniſhed in this world, and in the world to come; ſo they are pardoned in this world, and in the world to come: Pardoned in this world, when any temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction for ſin is removed. So I alſo underſtand that Parable in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. at the latter end; and pardoned in this life, when a man is juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. pardoned and forgiven in the world to come: So ſaith the Apoſtle in <hi>Acts,</hi> 3.19. <hi>That your ſins may be blotted out in the day of refreſhing:</hi> Which day of refreſhing, compared with the Speech which you have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of the World to come, ſhews that the day of Refreſhing is the time of the World to come; but it is an uſual phraſe with Scripture, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the eternity of miſery: and therefore if you look again into <hi>Mark</hi> 3. you ſhal find, That whereas here in <hi>Matthew,</hi> the words run thus; <hi>Shall not be forgiven, either in this World, or in the World to come; Mark</hi> hath it thus, <hi>He ſhall never be forgiven;</hi> that <hi>Never</hi> being the Explication of this, <hi>not in this World, nor in the World to come.</hi>

                        <hi>Secondly:</hi> How, and in what reſpect, this Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, is above all other ſins, the Unpardonable Sin.</p>

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102264:210"/> and yet not ſin the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">

Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. in Math. 12.</note> For as <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> obſerves, in his time there were divers Hereticks that did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Perſonality, and the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards repented, and were received into the boſom of the Church. And ye do not find that theſe Phariſees (who are here charged with this ſin) did either deny the Perſonality; or the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt. So that plainly then, the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, doth not conſiſt in this, The meer, and bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of the Perſonality, or the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly; As it doth not conſiſt therein, ſo neith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r doth it conſiſt in every oppoſition, or in a bare oppoſition unto the work of the Holy Ghoſt, as diſtinct from the Father and the Son: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the Father belongs Power; unto the Son, Wiſdom; unto the Spirit, Holineſs.

                     </gap> thought, That oppoſition unto Holineſs, is the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: But you find here it is a blaſphemy, therefore not every oppoſition. And if you look into <hi>Acts,</hi> 7. you find that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpeaking of the Jews, ſaith at verſe 51. <hi>Ye ſtiff necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and ear, ye do alwaies reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> yet they did not ſin this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Why? for <hi>Stephen</hi> praies for them, at the laſt verſe; <hi>Lord, lay not this ſin to their charge.</hi> But now ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5.16. <hi>There is a ſin unto Death, I do not ſay that ye ſhall pray for it.</hi> Had they in <hi>Stephens</hi> account, ſinned this Sin unto Death, he would not have prayed for them; but he did pray for them. So that this Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, doth not conſiſt in every oppoſition unto the Work of the Holy Ghoſt, as it is diſtinct from the Father and the Son.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly: As it doth not conſiſt therein, ſo it is not neceſſary that every man that ſins the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould be an Univerſal Apoſtate, back-ſliding from the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and the Power thereof: I know it is ordinarily thought ſo, but I ſay, it is not neceſſary that whoſoever doth ſin the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould be a Goſpel Apoſtate, back-ſliding from the Goſpel, and the Power thereof, once profeſt: for theſe Phariſees who ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, never profeſt the Goſpel, neither do we read of any back-ſliding in them, from the Power of the Goſpel once profeſt; and yet they ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Surely therefore, ſuch a Goſpel-Apoſtacy, is not of the eſſence of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Only here I muſt diſtinguiſh concerning the word Apoſtacy: A man may be ſaid to be an Apoſtate two waies: either becauſe he doth decline, and fall away from the Profeſſion of the Truth, and Power of Godlineſs
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102264:210"/> once profeſt; or elſe becauſe he doth rebel againſt Truth revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the Will of God manifeſted, and wil go no further. I wil expreſs it thus: Five or ſix men go a great Journey, ſuppoſe to <hi>Wales,</hi> or into the North, to <hi>Scotland;</hi> when they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the way, two or three of them ſay, theſe waies are dirty, and longer than we intended, and therefore we wil go no further; but ſay the other, Let the way be as dirty, and as long as it may be, we wil go on, and on they go: Which of theſe men do depart one from the other? do thoſe that go on depart from them that ſtay? No; thoſe that wil go no further depart, they are the forſakers. So in the way to Heaven, Profeſſors let out together, and ſome find the way long, further than they thought of, we wil go no further ſay they, and we wil have no more Light; but ſay the other, God willing we wil on, and on they go: Which of theſe two ſorts are the Apoſtates? Thoſe that wil go no further: they think not ſo, but the Lord knows the truth, that thoſe that wil go no further, are they that leave and forſake the other. I wil give you one Scripture for it, it is in <hi>Numbers,</hi> 14. there were certain Spies went into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and they brought an il report upon the good Land, <hi>And the Children of Iſrael murmured againſt</hi> Moſes, verſe 2. whereupon <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks unto them, and ſaith at verſe 9. <hi>Only rebel not againſt the Lord:</hi> the words in the Septuagint (which Greek the new Teſtament fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows) are, <hi>Only be not Apoſtates againſt the Lord.</hi> So that in Septuagintal Language, thoſe that rebel againſt Light revealed, and wil go no further, are called Apoſtates. Now indeed this kind of Apoſtacy, alwaies goes with the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but not the former alwaies; for we do not find that the Phariſees were guilty of the former, for they did not profeſs the Goſpel: So that the Eſſence of this ſin, doth not conſiſt in Apoſtatizing, or back-ſliding from the Profeſſion of the Goſpel, and the Power thereof.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: Some think that this Sin doth conſiſt in final Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and impenitency: But final Impenitency and Unbelief,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Altiſſiodorenſis</hi> Lib. 2. Tract. 30. in Sentent.

The latter cannot be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for many have purpoſed to continue in their Unbelief to their death, and yet have been converted and pardoned. And the firſt cannot be the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; For, 1. The Jews (whom Chriſt ſpake unto) did then commit this Sin, and yet they had not continued in it to their death. 2. Final Unbelief is rather a Sin againſt the Son: but the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is diſtinguiſhed from that. 3. Our Savior ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

If therefore, final Unbelief, or Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, be this ſin, then Chriſt ſhould threaten, that he that dies in his ſin, ſhal not be forgiven whilſt he lives. 4. If a man ſin againſt the Father, or Son, and die impenitently in that ſin, he ſhal not be forgiven, either in this Life, or in the Life to come: but herein the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is worſer than the Sins againſt the Father, or the Son, and therfore it cannot conſiſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.<note place="margin">1 John, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If an Enemy ſtrike you, you are angry; if your Friend ſtrike you, ye are grieved: If a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man ſtrike at God, he is angry with him; if a godly man ſtrike at God, God is angry, and his Spirit is grieved, becauſe he is a Friend. <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemption:</hi> So that thus far, poſſibly a man may go, and yet not ſin this Unpardonable Sin.</p>

But now, whoſoever you are, that have labored under this fear (as indeed this fear I know hath oppreſſed many) give me leave to ask you four or five ſhort Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is: Whether canſt thou not find in thy heart, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men that do treſpaſs againſt thee? Do not you find a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your own heart to forgive others? Yes, I praiſe the Lord that I do. Now if you can find in your heart to forgive others, I am ſure God can find in his heart to forgive you; and therefore you have not ſinned this great ſin, which is unpardonable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly: Whether, I or no, have you ever oppoſed the waies of God, the People of God, and that out of malice? No: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have oppoſed them, but the Lord knows I did it ignorantly, it was not out of malice; then remember the deſcription of this Sin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly: VVhether I or no, do not you deſire to be humbled for every Sin, though it be never ſo ſmal? Yes, for though I know, that my greateſt Humiliation cannot, <hi>placare Deum,</hi> make an attonement for my Sin; yet I know that the leaſt Humiliation in truth doth, <hi>placere Deo,</hi> pleaſe God, and it is my Duty to be humbled for every ſin; for the leaſt ſin is a great evil; and he that commands Humiliation for the one, commands it for the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and through Grace I deſire to be humbled for every ſin: why, then you cannot have ſin'd againſt the Holy Ghoſt; for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they that ſin this Sin, ſhould be renewed to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly: Whether, I, or no, do not you deſire above all things, the breathings of the Spirit of God upon your heart? Yes: O! that God would come and breath upon my poor ſoul in Duty. But thoſe that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to the Spirit of Grace, <hi>Hebrews,</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly: Where do you find in al the Bible, That thoſe that ſin this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are afraid that they have ſinned it? thoſe that ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are never afraid that they have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt. This alone ſatisfied Miſtriſs <hi>Drake,</hi> a Woman much troubled in Conſcience, ſhe was afraid ſhe had ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt; Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, came to her, and told her, That therefore ſhe had not ſinned the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, Becauſe ſhe feared ſhe had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; for thoſe that ſin the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are never afraid that they have ſinned it; and ſhe acknowledged, it did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie her, and ſhe was thereupon comforted. Now therefore, where is the man or woman that hath labored under ſuch a fear as this? O! I have ſinned this unpardonable Sin! Art thou one that feareſt thou haſt ſinned it? I tel thee from the Lord, thou art free from it; and thou maiſt go home, and ſay thus: Though I have ſinned much, for which the Lord humble me, yet I bleſs God I am kept from this great Sin: And O! my beloved, what a mercy is it, That among all the ſins that we have committed, That yet we ſhould be kept from this great Sin? The greater the evil is, the greater is the mercy to be kept from it. Now I pray, What is the miſery of this Sin? Is it not a great miſery to be paſt Prayer, to be thrown out of the Prayers of the Saints? <hi>For ſuch a one pray not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Is it not a great miſery for a man to be beyond the line of Mercy? a man that hath ſinned this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is worſer Spiritually, than a man that is ſick of the Plague outwardly; for if a man be ſick of the Plague, ye pray for him, and ſay, Lord, have mercy upon him; but if a man have ſinned this Sin, he is paſt Prayer, and paſt Pardon, he is paſt Sacrifice; the truth is, this man is in the Devils caſe: The Devil, you know, is reſerved in Chains unto the great Day, and he cannot get out: So, if a man hath ſinned this Sin, though he live ten yeers, twenty yeers, or thirty yeers, he is reſerved in Chains, and he ſhal never be pardoned, he is upon the Devils ground. O! what a miſery is it to commit this Sin! O! what a mercy is it then to be kept from it! Now here is Hope for the greateſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Congregation upon this account: ſaith our Savior, <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, except the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Haſt thou therefore been a great Sinner? Haſt thou been a Drunkard? Haſt thou been a Wanton? Haſt thou been a Swearer? Haſt thou been an Oppoſer
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:102264:217"/> of the People of the Lord? and hath the Lord kept thee from this great tranſgreſſion? Man or Woman, here is Hope yet. Who would not then turn to God? Come Drunkard, Swearer, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, here is yet hope for thy ſoul; who would not come in to Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>And O! What Comfort is here for Beleevers that are in Chriſt? If thou beeſt in Chriſt, and a Beleever, thou canſt not ſin this Sin: that look as it is with a man that hath ſinned this Sin, he cannot be pardoned; ſo if a man be the Child of God, a Beleever in Chriſt, he cannot ſin this Sin; for <hi>he that is born of God ſinneth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he, for the Seed of God abides in him.</hi> O! you that are Beleevers, comfort your ſelves with this Truth. Here is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for all the People of the Lord, from this Doctrine.</p>

Beloved! this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is the Profeſſors Sin; a man leſs than a Profeſſor cannot ſin this Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt; this Sin againſt the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, is the knowing mans ſin, a man leſs than a knowing man cannot ſin the Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt: And as I ſaid before, a man may poſſibly go very far in ſin, and yet not commit this great unpardonable Sin: So now on the other ſide I ſay, Poſſibly a man may go very far in Religion, and yet he may ſin this Sin: Theſe Phariſees that committed it, had the Key of Knowledg: knowing they were, and very knowing in the Scriptures; as for Zeal, they travelled Sea and Land to make a Proſelyte; for their Practice, they faſted twice a week, exceeding ſtrict in obſerving the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day, the Lights of the Church, and the Eyes of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were upon them for their Guides; and yet theſe men ſinned this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. O! what care ſhould there be in al our ſouls! how had we al need to look to our waies? The more Truth revealed, the more danger of ſinning this Sin, the more great Works of God are done by the very Spirit, and Finger of God; if men do oppoſe and blaſpheme, the more danger of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this great Sin. Now I wil appeal to you, When was there ever more Light revealed than in theſe daies of ours? yet when more oppoſing, and blaſpheming of it? When were there ever ſuch great Works done by the very Spirit and Finger of God? and yet when more oppoſing, and blaſpheming? Are there not ſome that have been convinced, that the Spirit of God breathed upon their hearts in ſuch and ſuch Ordinances, and ſuch and ſuch Waies, and yet now oppoſe and blaſpheme thoſe very waies of God, wherein they ſaid heretofore they had the Spirit of God? Are there not ſome that are convinced, that in theſe Times, great things are done by the very Finger, by the Power and Arm of God among us, and
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:102264:218"/> that in order to our ſalvation? and yet how do men ſpeak againſt them, and blaſpheme? I wil not ſay that theſe men do it out of malice, and therefore I do not charge this Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt upon them; But beloved in the Lord, this is certain, That in knowing Times, Times when God is doing great things by his own Finger, then is this Sin ſtirring moſt. The Times of Chriſt, and of the Apoſtles, were Times of great Light, when God wrought by his own Finger, then was this Sin committed. Now in theſe Times, there is much breaking forth of Light, and great things done by the very Finger of God; therefore I ſay, there is great danger if men do now blaſpheme; wherefore I ſay again, take heed to your ſouls, you that are Profeſſors, look to your ſteps in theſe daies of ours.</p>

The true Diſciple ſleeps, when he ſhould have prayed; and he ſlept again, and again, that was his ſin; for our Savior commanded them to watch and pray: but Chriſt wakened them, and would not leave them ſleeping; he came to them with his wakening mercy, and they were awakened, that was the iſſue of their ſin. But the falſe Diſciple <hi>Judas,</hi> was awake, and he watched unto what was evil: the good Diſciple ſlept unto what was good, and the falſe Diſciple watched unto what was evil; that was his ſin: <hi>For while Chriſt yet ſpake</hi> (ver. 17.) <hi>Lo</hi> Judas, <hi>one of the Twelve, came, and with him a great multitude, with Swords and Staves, from the chief Prieſts and Elders of the People.

Becauſe of their Unbelief, ſaith the Apoſtle. Now if you look into <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.19. you ſhal find that <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, <hi>Pardon I beſeech thee, O Lord, the iniquity of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, according to the greatneſs of thy mercy, and as thou haſt forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this People from</hi> Egypt, <hi>even till now: And the Lord ſaid, I have pardoned, according to thy word; But as truly as I live, all the Earth ſhall be filled with the Glory of the Lord.</hi> At ver. 22. <hi>Becauſe all theſe men which have ſeen my Glory, and my Miracles which I did in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and in the Wilderneſs, and have tempted me now theſe ten times, and have not hearkened to my voyce, ſurely they ſhal not ſee the Land, which I ſware to give unto their Fathers.</hi> Though I pardon them, ſaith God, they ſhal never come into <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Land of Reſt that I have promiſed; Why? Becauſe they have ſinned theſe ten times, murmuring again, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and again; ſo that it is exceedingly diſpleaſing unto the Lord, for a man to fal into the ſame ſin again, and again. But yet I ſay, it is poſſible that a good man, and true Diſciple of Chriſt, may fal into the ſame ſin, again, and again: It was a ſin for them thus to ſleep, when our Savior had commanded them to watch and pray; but they ſlept again, and again. Look I pray you it to <hi>Job</hi> 19. and ſee what <hi>Job</hi> ſaith concerning his friends; <hi>Theſe ten times</hi> (ſaith b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:102264:222"/> It is an evil thing to reproach a man, it is worſer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach a godly man, it is yet worſer to reproach a godly man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affliction, and to afflict the afflicted; but to reproach a man ten times, this is evil indeed: yet ſaith <hi>Job, Theſe ten times have ye reproached me;</hi> and yet <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends were godly. Poſſibly then, a good man may fal into the ſame ſin again, and again, ten times, that is very often. And you know how it was with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful; you read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 12. that when he was driven by reaſon of Famine, into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he deſired his Wife <hi>Sarah</hi> to ſay, that ſhe was his Siſter; which indeed was no lye, but his ſin of Unbelief, and very evil; for thereby he put his Wife upon a great Temptation; he was reproved for it, as you read in the Chapter: yet if you look into the 20. Chapter, you ſhal find, that he was at the ſame work again, <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyed towards the South Country; and</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid</hi> (at ver. 2.) <hi>of</hi> Sarah <hi>his Wife, ſhe is my Siſter.</hi> And ſo alſo if you look into 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. you ſhal find it was thus with that good King <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaphat,</hi> complying too much with the King of Iſrael, for which he is reproved, at verſe 2. <hi>And</hi> Jehu <hi>went out to meet him, and ſaid to King</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>ſhouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord? therfore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord:</hi> yet if you look into the 20. Chapter, you ſhal find, that he fals into the ſame ſin again: <hi>And</hi> Eliazar <hi>propheſied againſt</hi> Jehoſaphat, <hi>ſaying,</hi> (at the laſt verſe) <hi>Becauſe thou haſt joyned thy ſelf with</hi> Ahaziah, <hi>the Lord hath broken thy works; and the Ships were broken, that they were not able to go to</hi> Tarſhiſh. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſaphat</hi> a good man, yet he fals into the ſame ſin again: So that I ſhal not need to ſpend longer time in this, it is too apparent, Poſſibly a good man, a true Diſciple of Chriſt, may fal into the ſame Sin again, and again. That is the Firſt.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly:</hi> Though a man do fall into the ſame Sin, again, and again, yet it may be but an Infirmity</q>
                  <p>For the opening, and cleering of this, we muſt conſider what a Sin of Infirmity is, and what is the true notion of it: which being cleered, the Truth propoſed wil Naturally fal into your boſom. Properly therefore, a Sin of Infirmity, is that ſin, which doth rather ariſe from want of ſtrength to reſiſt, than from wil to commit; elſe it ſhould be wickedneſs, and not weakneſs.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But in Scripture Phraſe, it is called a weakneſs; as here in this Chapter, <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak</hi> and Rom. 6.19. I <hi>ſpeak after the manner of men, becauſe of the infirmity, or weakneſs of your fleſh.</hi> And therefore,</p>

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It muſt be in one that hath Spiritual Life: You do not ſay that a ſtone is infirm, or weak; Why? Becauſe a ſtone hath no life in it: infirmity is a defect in one that hath life.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And I ſay, it doth ariſe, not from wilfulneſs, but want of ſtrength to reſiſt. Now this want of ſtrength to reſiſt, doth either ariſe from ſome Natural cauſe, which one cannot avoid; of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.19. <hi>The good that</hi> I <hi>would,</hi> I <hi>do not; but the evil which</hi> I <hi>would not, that</hi> I <hi>do:</hi> and why ſo? he gives the reaſon at verſe 21. I <hi>find then a Law, that when</hi> I <hi>would do good, evil is preſent with me;</hi> and verſe 23. I <hi>find a Law in my Members, fighting againſt the Law of my Mind, and leading me captive, &amp;c.</hi> Or elſe it doth ariſe from ſome preſent diſtemper, and that either in the Mind and Judgment, and then it is called an Error, <hi>Who knoweth the Errors of his Life?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 19. Heb. 3.2.</note> Or elſe this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper doth ariſe from ſome preſent paſſion, fear, or the like, whereby a man is hurried into evil, and then he is ſaid to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. So that when a man is alive unto God, and doth commit a Sin for want of ſtrength to reſiſt, then he is ſaid to ſin out of infirmity.</p>
                  <p>Firſt: Therfore if you ask,<note place="margin">The ſins whereinto the godly falleth, are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, but are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of weakneſs, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. <hi>Perkins Caſes, Book 1. Chap. 2.</hi>
                     </note> Whether every Sin that a godly man doth commit, be a Sin of infirmity? I anſwer, No. Becauſe there are ſome Sins that a godly man doth commit, which he hath ſtrength to avoid.

                     <hi>We have not ſuch an High Prieſt who cannot be touched with our infirmities:</hi> And thus al the Sins of the Godly, may be, and are Sins of Infirmity.

And if a man cannot endure to be deceived in leſſer things, what an evil thing is it then, to be deceived in the matters of his Soul? Such are the things, that theſe falſe Teachers do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men in; yea, they wil, and do ſubvert mens Faith, and ſpoil them of the very Fundamentals of their Religion.

If he be called to a Work only, then his preaching is called Propheſie: And ſo ſome are called to Preach; for elſe how ſhould we know whether men be ſit for Office, if they may not preach before they be in Office? Now if men be ſo called to preach, then they muſt, 1. Preach according to the proportion, and Analogy of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. 2. If they be ſo called to preach, they muſt have a gift to profit others pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly; for al Propheſie is for Exhortation, Edification, and Comfort, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3. 3. And if they be ſo called to preach, they muſt ſubmit what they ſpeak to the Judgment of others: The Officer ſpeaks with Authority; but another ſpeaks with Submiſſion, <hi>and let the reſt judg,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.29. So that, if any man wil take upon him to preach and teach as a gifted man, if he have not a Gift to profit others in publick; a Gift be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly: But if a man be called to Office; then his Office, is either Extraordinary, or Ordinary.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If Extraordinary, then he is either a Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>herefore ceaſed, then the Evangeliſts ceaſed; for <hi>ſublato ſubjecto tollitur ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctum.</hi> Or he is an Apoſtle who hath ſeen the Lord, and is immediately ſent by him, whoſe Commiſſion extendeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the World, who is infallible in regard of Doctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, having the Gifts of Tongues given him; not by Induſtry, but by Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, and doth work Miracles. And therefore if any man ſay, that he is an Apoſtle, and yet hath not ſeen the Lord Chriſt, nor hath theſe Gifts of Tongues, nor can work Miracles; then he is a falſe Apoſtle, and a falſe Teacher in that kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But if a man be called to an Ordinary Office, then, 1. He muſt be apparently Godly; not only free from Vice, and Scandal; but Holy, and blameleſs, ſhining with poſitive Vertues, as wel as free from Scandalous ſins, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. He muſt be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and gifted for the work of preaching, being apt to teach, anointed with the Unction of the Holy One; not that he muſt neceſſarily have the extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt: for when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſets down the due qualifications of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. there is not one word of that. 3. Being gifted, and duely qualified, he muſt be choſen, or deſired by the Church, <hi>Acts,</hi> 14.23. 4. Then having conſented, he muſt be ſeparated to the Work of the Miniſtry. And therefore if any man ſay, that he is a Teacher in Office, ordinarily called, and yet be prophane, ſcandalous, or vicious, or ignorant, being not fitly qualified; or is not deſired, or choſen by the Church, and ſeparated to the Work of the Miniſtry, he is a falſe Teacher in this kind.</p>
                  <p>But whether a mans Cal be Ordinary, or Extraordinary; whether he be called, <hi>ad Opus,</hi> to a Work, or <hi>ad Munus,</hi> to an Office, he muſt make out his Cal to others; 'tis not enough to ſay, I am ſent of God, I tel thee I am ſent of God: The Apoſtles themſelves made out their Cal to others: <hi>Do ye require a proof of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, or Apoſtleſhip?</hi> ſaies the Apoſtle <hi>Paul;</hi> then thus and thus. So that though a man do pretend that he is ſent of God, and that he hath ſeen the Lord; yet if he be not able to give an account thereof unto others, he is ſurely a Falſe Apoſtle, and a Falſe Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. Thus may you try, and diſcover men by their Cal.</p>

But for his Deity, the Apoſtle tel us, that he is very God, and the only wiſe God, 1 <hi>John,</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p>And for the Body of Chriſt: The true Apoſtles tel us, That he did not only riſe from the dead, but his Body aſcended, and that he is man ſtil, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator, the man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

They did not lay a neceſſity upon the Diſciples, to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the River, or Water; for the Jaylor, and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> were baptized in their Houſes: Nor did they ever forbid Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but tel us that Children of Beleevers, are Holy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3.

Doth any man therefore ſay, I now come unto you from God, and God hath ſent me? And doth he ſay, there is no other Heaven, nor Hel, than what is in this Life? Or doth he preach againſt the Reſurrection, and Aſcention of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? Or doth he preach againſt reſpect unto Magiſtrates, and Civil Relations? Or doth he tel you of a Light within al men,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:102264:240"/> which is able to bring them to Salvation? Doth he preach Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſaying, That Man may be perfect, and without ſin in this Life? Or doth he tel you of Juſtification by ſomwhat within you? Or doth he cry down, degrade, and vilifie the Ordinances of Chriſt, Miniſtry, Water Baptiſm, Lords Supper, and Singing? Or doth he deny the Deity of Chriſt on Earth? or the Humanity of Chriſt in Heaven? Or doth he preach down the Scripture, by telling you, that the Light and Spirit within you, is your Rule? Surely this Perſon is a falſe Apoſtle, and a falſe Teacher. Thus you may try a man by his Doctrine.</p>

This alſo is a Fruit of Gods Anger; and when a People are in this poſture, it argues that God hath ſmitten them in his Anger. But when may a People be ſaid to be thus ſmitten, as a Reed ſhaken in the Water?

In the former part of the Chapter, the Apoſtle doth inſtance in ſeveral Beleevers at large: In the latter part, he is more compendious, and draws up the Inſtances into a narrower Room; for ſaith he, The time would fail me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102264:261"/> doth inſtance in, in the latter part of the Chapter, are of two ſorts: ſome famous, and of good reports for their actions; and ſome for their ſufferings: ſome did great things, and ſome ſuffered great things, and both by their Faith: Thoſe that ſuffered great things, are mentioned in the following words: <hi>Others were tortured, not accepting of deliverance.</hi> Thoſe that did great things by their Faith in theſe Verſes: their Perſons are mentioned, and the fruits and effects of their Faith, for which they are mentioned in theſe Verſes. Their Perſons are mentioned in Verſe 32. ye have their Names there; their State, Condition, and their Order: their Names, <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon,,</hi> and <hi>Jeptha,</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> their State and Condition, ſome were Kings, ſome were Judges, ſome were Prophets: Faith runs through al Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Ranks of Men; Faith, and true Grace, is able to make a Plantation upon every Condition of men. And as for their order here, <hi>Gideon</hi> is before <hi>Barak,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon</hi> is before <hi>Jeptha:</hi> yet if you look into the Story in the <hi>Judges,</hi> you ſhal find <hi>Barak</hi> is before <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Jeptha</hi> before <hi>Sampſon;</hi> and here <hi>Gideon</hi> ſet firſt, and <hi>Sampſon</hi> firſt, why? becauſe they excelled in Faith, and thoſe are moſt excellent in Gods eyes, who are moſt eminent in Faith; thoſe are moſt excellent in Gods Eyes, who moſt excel in Faith. But now as for the Fruits and Effects of their Faith, they are many, here are no leſs than ten mentioned in theſe Verſes. Firſt they ſubdued Kingdoms, verſe 33. <hi>who through Faith ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Kingdoms;</hi> ſo the Judges did, and ſo <hi>David</hi> alſo. And 2. They wrought Righteouſneſs; ſo <hi>Samuel</hi> did, <hi>Whoſe Ox have I taken?</hi> and ſo <hi>David</hi> did When he ſpared <hi>Saul.</hi> And 3. They obtained Promiſes; Promiſes, that is the thing promiſed; God is ſo Faithful, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> in fulfilling his Promiſes, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is put for the thing promiſed; they obtained the Promiſes, that is, the thing promiſed. Now the Promiſe they obtained, it was not the great Promiſe of the Meſſias; for ſo at verſe 39. <hi>They received not the Promiſe,</hi> that is, the great Promiſe of the Meſſias; but the Promiſes they obtained, were particular Promiſes of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, Victories, and Kingdoms; ſo they obtained Promiſes, and ſo <hi>Gideon,</hi> and <hi>Barak, David,</hi> and others did. And then they ſtopped the mouths of Lyons; ſo <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> did. And they quenched the violence of Fire; ſo the three Children did. And eſcaped the edg, or mouth of the Sword; ſo <hi>Elijah,</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> did. And out of weakneſs were made ſtrong; ſo <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Firſt: True ſaving Faith, is a doing Grace, an active, working, doing, operative Grace: the more Spirits any thing hath, the more active it is: Faith, true ſaving Faith, hath the Spirit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in it; the Goſpel is the Miniſtration of the Spirit, and true ſaving Faith, it hath the Spirit of this Spiritful Diſpenſation; and therfore it muſt needs be a very ſpiritual, and a working Grace. It is called a work it ſelf, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Remembring without ceaſing, your work Faith;</hi> and in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>The work of Faith with power.</hi> Our Lord and Savior Chriſt ſaith, it is the Work of God; <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye beleeve;</hi> it is in it ſelf a work. And, </p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Secondly: It is a friend to work: true ſaving Faith, it is a Work, and it is a great Friend to work; it is not an idle Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife. What is our Sanctification, but our Faith incarnate; it works Love, and it works by Love; and Love is very inventive, active, and expenſive: it is a friend to work; a work in it ſelf, and a friend to work. And </p>
                  <p>Thirdly: It is alſo the firſt worker in the Soul. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, and do good;</hi> not firſt do good, and then truſt in the Lord, truſt in the Lord firſt, truſt in the Lord, and do good: it is the work that ſets other works on work, the wheel that ſets al other wheels a going; without which, a man is idle, though he be at work. As a Child may be very buſie at his play, yet but play; and a Servant may be very buſie about his own imployment, and yet his Maſter counts it an idleneſs, becauſe he is not about his work appointed him. So now, a man may be very buſie in regard of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102264:262"/> world, and yet he may be idle God-ward, <hi>Niſi a Deo agendo, nil ages;</hi> Faith muſt be the firſt Worker, and if Faith be not the firſt, al other works are as nothing. Yea,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: As Faith is a Work, and a Friend of Work, and a firſt Worker; ſo it is an Univerſal Work: Faith is that Grace that can turn its hand to every Work; ſome can work exactly at one thing, but they are bunglers at another: but Faith, true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, can turn its hand to every buſineſs: Poſſibly a man may be ſick, and he cannot pray himſelf; but yet he may beleeve; though Prayer cannot turn its hand to this Condition, yet Faith can. Poſſibly a man may be very poor, and is not able to help a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; Liberality cannot turn its hand to this Condition, but Faith can work in it.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly: And not only ſo, but Faith works beſt, when it works alone, when it works al alone; If Comfort come, and ſence, and feeling come, Faith knows how to uſe theſe; but though a man have no Sence, and no Comfort, yet Faith can work, and Faith works beſt, when it works alone, when it work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly: Yea, Faith works beſt ſomtimes, when it works in the dark; as it works beſt when it works alone, ſo ſomtimes, it works beſt in the dark. Men can work wel in the light, but not in the dark; but though a mans condition be very dark, yet Faith can work then; Faith works beſt when it works in the dark: Faith loves to work like Chriſt, and Chriſts greateſt action of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, was in the darkeſt time, when he was on the Croſs. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a Speech of that good old man, Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> when a man that was troubled in his mind lay a dying, he ſaid to him, Sir, what wil you ſay to Chriſt? when he was dying, did he not ſay, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And was not Chriſts higheſt piece of Obedience upon the Croſs, in the dark, in a dark condition? Faith works beſt ſomtimes in the dark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly: Yet further, Faith, it works beſt at the laſt, and the longer it works, the better; for Faith grows by experience, and the longer that Faith works, the more experience it gets; and the more experience Faith gets, the ſtronger it is, and therefore Faith works beſt at the laſt. Now put al theſe together, Faith is a Work, and Faith is a Friend to Work, and Faith is the firſt Worker, and Faith is an Univerſal Worker, and Faith works beſt when it works al alone, and Faith works beſt ſomtimes in the dark, and Faith works beſt at the laſt; and certainly you have the firſt, namely this, That true ſaving Faith is a doing Grace, it is a working Grace. But

                        <hi>Secondly: You wil ſay,</hi> What are thoſe great things that Faith will do? for we have heard that Faith is a doing Grace, that is the Doctrine; Faith will do, and do great things; but what are thoſe great things that Faith will do ſtill?</q>

                  <p>Faith, true ſaving Faith, it wil reſiſt great Temptations; it wil perform great Performances; it wil ſuppreſs al your Fears, it wil mortifie al your Cares; it wil aſſwage and ſubdue al your Griefs; it wil make you a ſtranger in this World; it wil keep your hearts ſteady and upright, in al the turnings and changes of your Life; it wil make you faithful under al your Betruſtments; it wil reallize Eternity to you, and make thoſe things viſible to you, that are in themſelves inviſible; and it wil make you live in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dependance on Chriſt, and fetch al from him: Al theſe things are great things, and I muſt not dwel upon any of them, but only touch upon each of them.</p>

                  <p>But then to ſpeak to it yet more Comparatively; there are two or three great Agents in the World, that are cloſe at work, and Faith wil out-work them al, and do greater things than any of them. 1. There is a Carnal Policy, with Power, which is a great Agent, and Worker, in reference to the Affairs of the World. 2. There is Civil Honeſty, a great Agent in reference to our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling between man and man. And 3. There are Goſpel Gifts, Parts, and common Grace, which are great Agents in reference to our Religion. Now, not to ſhow the difference between them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102264:263"/> but to give you a little taſt, that I may make out the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That Faith doth work beyond al. And</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt of al: If you compare it with Power, Power cloathed with Policy, or Policy cloathed with Power: Faith wil do more than al Policy and Power can do. And I pray turn unto 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. where you ſhal ſee this cleerly proved to you, verſe 3. There is a great Battel fought; <hi>And</hi> Abijah <hi>ſet the Battel in Array, with an Army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thouſand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen men:</hi> Jeroboam <hi>alſo ſet the Battel in Array with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand choſen men, being mighty men of Valor:</hi> Jeroboam had as many again, <hi>Abijah</hi> but four hundred thouſand. Now if you look into verſe 16. it is ſaid the Children of Iſrael fled before <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Abijah,</hi> and his People, ſlew them with a great ſlaughter, verſe 17. So there fel down ſlain of Iſrael, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand choſen men, ſuch a ſlaughter as you ſhal not hear of: <hi>Abijah</hi> had but four hundred thouſand men, and they ſlew five hundred thouſand, Why? they had power enough, they were as many again: What was the matter, did they wane Policy? it is ſaid verſe 13. But <hi>Jeroboam</hi> cauſed an Ambuſhment to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; ſo they were before <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Ambuſhment was behind them: here was Power, and here was Policy, and yet this great Army is beaten with half the Company, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand ſlain: How comes this to paſs? Indeed you read of the Children of <hi>Judah,</hi> That they cryed unto the Lord, <hi>They cried unto the Lord,</hi> at verſe 14. But if you wil have the reaſon, look to verſe 18. <hi>Thus the Children of Iſrael were brought under at that time; and the Children of Judah prevailed, becauſe they relied on the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> See Faith can do more than al the Power and Policy in the World can do; true ſaving Faith can do more in reference to the Affairs of the World too: What Power is able to turn the Tide? if the Tide come in, and go out, you may bring in your Veſſels with it, or ſend out your Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; who is able to turn the Tide? What power on Earth is able to turn the Tide? And what power of men can turn the power of Providence? or Policy of men, can turn the Tide of Providence? But Faith can do it, true ſaving Faith can turn the Tide, even of Providence; and therefore it can do greater things than al Power, the greatneſs of the World joyned with Policy.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly: There is another great Agent in the World, and that is civil honeſty, and morality, which deals much between man and man; How may it appear that Faith can do greater things than this?</p>
                  <p>That appears plainly thus:</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Civil Honeſty, and Morality, doth trade but in ſmal matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102264:264"/> and therefore the Civil, Honeſt, Moral man, he never breaks in his Profeſſion, Why? Becauſe he trades not in great matters. When do you hear a noiſe of a poor mans breaking? when a great, rich Merchant breaks, you have the noiſe of it through the City: When do you hear of Ships, or Veſſels miſcarrying in narrow Waters? in the Seas, Ships that launch out to Sea, they are Shipwrack'd; but thoſe that trade in narrow Waters, they ſeldom, or never Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. So thoſe Profeſſors that launch forth into the Ocean of the Goſpel, they break ſomtimes; but the civil, moral man, he bleſſeth himſelf when he ſees this; Theſe (ſaies he) are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant men, theſe are uneven men, ſomtimes for this, and ſomtimes for that Opinion; but I am conſtant: Whereas the Truth is, it is becauſe he trades in Warrow Water, in ſmal things, and ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breaks, never ſuffers Ship-wrack. But now, true ſaving Faith trades in the high things of the Goſpel.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Though Parts and Gifts may be very uſeful unto the Body, yet they wil never make a perfect change in a man: Suppoſe a man hath very good Parts and Gifts, and withal he be given to paſſion, ye ſhal obſerve, his Goſpel Parts and Gifts, wil never take away his Paſſion, but he is as paſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As for common Grace, Though a man may riſe to a very great Profeſſion thereby, he wil never hold it; theſe Colors are not laid in Goſpel Oyl, and it wil never hold, it is but a varniſh, and it wil off. But ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We are kept by the Power of God through Faith;</hi> Faith wil hold. You ſee how it is with the Leather that a man wears on his Shoo, it wil wear out; there are ſome poor people that go without Shoos, and their Skin is thin, not ſo thick as the Leather, and yet it wears not off, Why?

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly: If you would ſo improve your Faith, that you may do great things thereby, uſe your Faith to do ſmal things, put your Faith to work every day, uſe your Faith to do ſmal things. It is a good Rule; Do not commit any ſin, becauſe it is ſmal; do not neglect any Duty, becauſe it is not great: and though the thing be ſmal, put your Faith to work in ordinary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, put your Faith to work. Somtimes you come to a great matter, and you put on your Faith there; but becauſe your Faith is not uſed to ſmal things, your Faith wil not come on here.

So ſay I in the point of Doing; You wil never be able to do great things by Faith, if your faith be not uſed to do ſmal things. And therefore Chriſtians, in al things you do, the Life you live in the fleſh, put your faith to work in your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings, in ſmal things; and when your faith is uſed to do ſmal things, you wil be able to do great things; but you wil never be able to improve your faith to do great things, if you uſe not your faith to do ſmal things.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, and Laſtly: Study much, and look much upon the Cal you have to any Work, and do not ſtand poring upon your own ability, or upon the difficulty of the work: Thus theſe Worthies, when the Lord called them, the work was great awd difficult, and they were weak; but they looked upon Gods Cal, and they did not ſtand poring upon their own Abilities; but as <hi>Abraham</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not his own Body, ſo theſe, and therefore they did great things by faith. Poſſibly a man is called to a Place in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and he looks upon it as a great Work; I am not able (ſaith he) it is beyond me: So a man is called to the Miniſtry, I have no Parts, nor Gifts, the Work is beyond me. So for beleeving, a man is commanded to beleeve, but I cannot beleeve, my heart is dead, I cannot beleeve: whereas now, if men did but look upon the Cal of God, they would be able to do great things for God. Either Chriſtian, thou art commanded to beleeve, or not: If thou are not commanded to beleeve, then Unbelief is no ſin; and if you are commanded to beleeve, then you are called to it; do not ſtand poring upon the Difficulty of your Work, but look upon the Cal of God; and thus ſhal your faith work, and do great things. And thus I have done with the main Doctrine that grows out of theſe words.

O! you that have no faith at al (and ſome ſuch there may be here) you that have no faith at al, get faith, get faith; and you that have true ſaving faith, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it to do great things by it; and the Truth is, if you have true ſaving faith, you wil do it, and there wil be ſome great things found in your Converſation: for you remember the Doctrine, True ſaving faith wil do very great things.

In Scripture Phraſe, Afflictions are Deaths, and when a man is delivered from an Affliction, he hath a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: When a man hath been ſick, and at the Grave, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to health again, he hath a Reſurrection, in Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: Now this Reſurrection, or deliverance, is refuſed, hoping for a better Reſurrection, having an eye to the great, and laſt, and better Reſurrection. That is the firſt, They were tortured, or racked. And 2. They had cruel mockings; there is a mocking, and there is a cruel mocking, when a man ſhal inſult over another, and laugh at him in his miſery, this is a cruel mocking; as the Jews derided our Savior on the Croſs; this is a great aggravation of Affliction, this they endured: that is a ſecond, They had trial of cruel mockings.

You know there is an old enmity between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent; a malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the men of the world againſt the Saints, and People of God, they muſt work as they are; the wicked, and men of the world, are an unworthy people.

Now if the men of the world, be an unworthy People, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, wil ye wonder that the Saints, and People of God, meet ſomtimes with unworthy uſage from them? It is poſſible. To raiſe it a little higher; poſſibly, the more precious a man is, the more unworthy uſage he may meet withal. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was a moſt precious man in his day, and Generation, and yet what unworthy uſage had he? It is ſaid in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feted, and have no certain dwelling place, and labor working with our own hands; being reviled, we bleſs; being perſecuted, we ſuffer it; being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day:</hi> We are the filth, we are made the filth of the world, and the off-ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of al things unto this day. Some think that the Apoſtle here, doth relate unto that of one man dying for the People, the guilt of al the People being upon him. Others, that it is a ſimilitude ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from a kind of Tumbrel, and Veſſel that goes up and down the City, that ye throw al the filth into. But I rather take the two Greek words, <gap reason="foreign">

So that I ſay, it is poſſible that the more precious a man is, the more unworthy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he may meet withal from men</p>
                  <p>Yea, to raiſe it a little higher: It is poſſible that a man may meet with moſt unworthy dealings therefore, becauſe he is precious in the eyes of God; not only in regard of men; but in regard of God: For God doth ſomtimes ſo order things in his Providence, that he doth put men to ſuffer hard things, becauſe they are precious in his Eyes. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you it is given, not only to beleeve, but to ſuffer.</hi> Suffering ſomtimes is a Gift, it is a great Gift: A ſuffering Gift, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> is a greater Gift, than the Gift of Miracles; for ſaith he, if God do give me a Gift to work Miracles by, I am in Gods debt; but if God do give me a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Gift, he is pleaſed thereby to become my Debtor; ſuffering
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102264:271" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſomtimes becomes as a reward for Doing. Ye read of the Heifers that brought home the Ark out of the Philiſtims Country, that when they brought the Ark home, the Iſraelites they take the Heifers, and they offer up the Heifers unto God for a Sacrifice; why ſo, ſaith one? it is an il requital to the Heifers: No, the Heifers could not have a higher Honor put upon them; this their Suffering, is a Reward for their Doing. And ſo, what greater Honor can a man have after al his Doing for God, than to be called forth to Suffer, and to bear witneſs to the Truth? Indeed we do not think thus, but you wil ſay, O! ſurely God doth not love me, becauſe he puts ſuch hard ſuffering work upon me. But I pray tel me, Suppoſe that a General ſhould have ſome great Work or Service to do, and he ſhould ſingle, and pick ſome half a dozen Soldiers for to go upon this work; would theſe Soldiers ſay, ſurely the General doth not prize us, he doth not honor us, nor love us, becauſe he puts us upon this hard Service: No, but they wil ſay the contrary; ſurely the General prizeth us, loves us, and honors us, becauſe he puts us upon ſuch a hard Service as this is. So here, it doth rather argue that the Lord doth honor, love, and prize you, in that he puts you upon a hard work, and Service. But now, if theſe things be true, then ſurely this firſt Branch is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made out, That a man may be very precious in the Eyes of God, and yet meet with moſt unworthy uſage from the hands of men. That is the firſt thing.</p>

Now it is Faith only that doth Trade with the Call of God; Gods Call is a great Wal, a ſtrong Wal; Gods Call can make a Wal of Water. When the Children of Iſrael went through the red Sea, the Water ſtood like a Wal on each ſide; it was Gods Cal that made thoſe Wals: there is nothing but Faith that doth converſe with the Call of God, and makes out the Cal of God. Three things cal us to ſuffer: 1. The Commandement of Chriſt, <hi>If thou wilt be my Diſciple, thou muſt deny thy ſelf, and take up thy Croſs.</hi> 2. The Example of Chriſt, for thereunto are we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Chriſt hath left us an example of Suffering. And 3. Suffering ſtrength with ſuffering opportunity. Now there is nothing but Faith is able to diſcern theſe things; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, and Faith alone, is that Grace under Chriſt, which can carry us through our affliction, and Suffering, although they be never ſo great.</p>

That day that thou wert converted, and brought home to God, thy Soul was freed; thoſe that the Son makes free, they are free indeed; though your wil were not <hi>libera,</hi> yet it was <hi>liberata;</hi> as ſoon as a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and brought home to God, he is free to Duty, though not free from Duty; and he is free from his ſin, though he be not free to his ſin.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt you may conſider here, what the Perſons were that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hard things; the Text ſaith, they were ſuch, of whom the World was not worthy: then greatneſs of Sufferings, and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are no ſufficient reaſon why you ſhould doubt of Gods Love, or of your own everlaſting Condition. Here were very hard things that theſe Beleevers ſuffered, and yet they were ſuch of whom the World was not worthy: Shal I then doubt of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or queſtion Gods Love, becauſe my Afflictions are great? I muſt not. But you wil ſay, My Afflictions are very ſtrange, and none like mine; one cannot hear of ſuch an Affliction as mine is, not in an Age. And I pray, in your Age, have you heard of a Man or Woman ſawn aſunder? thus were theſe, of whom the World was not worthy. But my Afflictions are thick, they come very thick. And ſo did theirs here. But my Afflictions are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Temptations; I am not only afflicted, but I am temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Temptations grow upon mine Afflictions. So it was with theſe here, they were tempted, not only afflicted, but temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet ſuch of whom the World was not worthy. But my Afflictions are ſuch as make me Unſerviceable. So in the eye of Reaſon theſe Afflictions made theſe Beleevers, they were whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up and down like Rogues: and I pray you tel me, who would ever have thought in the eye of Reaſon, that <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry ſhould have done any great good, after he had been whipped up and down like a Rogue? yet <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtry was bleſſed, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102264:277" rendition="simple:additions"/> though you think your Afflictions make you unſerviceable, if God cal you to them, he wil take care for your Service. But my Afflictions are ſuch as find me al alone; I am afflicted, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, a man or woman of Affliction, and I have none to pity me. So it was here with ſome of theſe; they wandred in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and they were in the Caves, and Dens of the Earth, and ſuch of whom the World was not worthy. Poſſibly then, thy Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, man or woman, may be very great, and yet thou maieſt be precious in the Eyes of God, and ſuch a one of whom the world is not worthy. And therefore now, if there be ever a man or woman here in al this Congregation, that labors under any great burden, I ſay to that Perſon, queſtion not thy Condition, doubt not concerning Gods Love, becauſe of the greatneſs of thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thy Affliction may be very great, and yet thou maiſt be a Perſon, of whom the World is not worthy in Gods account. I wil give you this Parable, apply it your ſelf: Suppoſe you ſee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of children playing together one while, and may be afterwards fighting; and then you ſee a man come and carry away one of theſe Children, and he ſtrikes him, but he lets the other alone, and he ſtrikes them not; which of theſe Children, wil you ſay, this man is a Father unto? wil ye not ſay, in al likelyhood he is a Father unto that Child that he carries away, and ſtrikes. I leave you to apply it.</p>

It may be, men wil not ſpeak out here with you, but they have done it with us, and nibble at this Doctrine: What ſhal we ſay to them? they are Enemies to your Faith, they are Enemies to your great relief in Suffering times, they are Enemies to your good Conſcience, a good Conſcience is a great matter in Suffering times. I remember a Speech of a good Miniſter, when he was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced in the Biſhops time, and had his Living taken from him; Wel (ſaith he) I praiſe the Lord, though I have loſt my Living, I have ſaved my Conſcience and this Conſcience is a great matter in Suffering times. Now by their having an expectance of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reſurrection, they refuſed the preſent Deliverance, and ſo kept their Conſcience. Do there therefore come in men among you, to ſteal away this great Doctrine of our Reſurrection? avoid them, avoid them, that they may be aſhamed, hold cloſe to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: As you deſire (Chriſtians) to have Comfort in a rainy day, and a bottom for your Faith in Suffering times, hold faſt this Doctrine of the Reſurrection, and this Doctrine that you have been inſtructed in from the Word.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, and ſo to end: Ye may obſerve here, by what means they ſuffered theſe hard things, and that is, as you have heard, by Faith; ſurely then, it is no eaſie thing to beleeve, with this true ſaving Faith; a hard thing to beleeve. This true ſaving Faith can do great things, and it can ſuffer hard things; true ſaving Faith wil make it eaſie to do great things, and eaſie to ſuffer hard things. But it is hard to get this true ſaving Faith. You wil ſay, If a man were in the Sun, he might go round the World in a day; but it is hard to get into the Sun. So this true ſaving Faith, wil make a man to do great things, and to ſuffer hard things; but it is a hard thing to get it, and few there be that have it. We read of <hi>Elias,</hi> that when the Lord had given him a power to ſhut Heaven, that it rained not for three yeers, and an half, he went away, and hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; they could find him before: ordinary men might be found; but <hi>Elias</hi> that did this great Work, could not be found. So an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Faith may be found out; but this true ſaving Faith, that doth great things, and ſuffers hard things, is hardly to be found. There is a common Faith that grows every where: As it is in your Flowers and Plants; ye have your Field Time, and your Garden Time; ye have your Field Roſe, and your Garden Roſe; your Field Roſe grows every where, but your Garden Roſe grows not every where: You have Pibble Stones every where, but Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds are not to be found every where. So there is a Pibble Faith, and a Field Faith, an ordinary Faith, and this you may have eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where: But this Diamond, this Garden Faith, to ſuffer hard things, it is hard to be found, few there be that have it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few can do great things for God, or ſuffer hard things from men. Wherefore beloved in the Lord, give me leave to end with this Exhortation, to beſeech you in Chriſt Jeſus, to get this Faith, above al getting, get this Faith; you that have not this true ſaving Faith, get it. Some there be here, it may be, that have Faith good enough to ſwear by; but not Faith good enough to live by: true ſaving Faith, a Beleever can live by, but he cannot ſwear by it. A true Beleever is very ſenſible of his Unbelief; ſaith he, there was never a more unbeleeving heart than mine, I think there is not a man, or woman in the World, is troubled with ſuch an unbeleeving heart as I. True ſaving Faith is ſenſible of Unbeleef; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you that have not this true ſaving Faith, labor to get it; above al get it: Get this true ſaving Faith, and you that have this true ſaving Faith, improve it, uſe it, do great things for God, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer hard things from man; yea, certainly, if you have this true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Faith, you wil be able to do great things for God, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer very hard things from man; for that is the Doctrine at this time, <hi>True ſaving Faith can, and will ſuffer very hard things.</hi>
